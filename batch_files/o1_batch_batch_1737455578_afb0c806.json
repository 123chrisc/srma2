Such information is essential for health planners, as many of those infected show no or only mild symptoms and thus, escape the surveillance system. We therefore aimed to describe the course of the pandemic in the Munich general population living in private households from April 2020 to January 2021.\n\nMethods The KoCo19 baseline study took place from April to June 2020 including 5313 participants (age 14 years and above). From November 2020 to January 2021, we could again measure SARS-CoV-2 antibody status in 4,433 of the baseline participants (response 83%). Participants were offered a self-sampling kit to take a capillary blood sample (dry blood spot; DBS). Blood was analysed using the Elecsys\u00ae Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche). Questionnaire information on socio-demographics and potential risk factors assessed at baseline was available for all participants. In addition, follow-up information on health-risk taking behaviour and number of personal contacts outside the household (N=2768) as well as leisure time activities (N=1263) were collected in summer 2020.\n\nResults Weighted and adjusted (for specificity and sensitivity) SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence at follow-up was 3.6% (95% CI 2.9-4.3%) as compared to 1.8% (95% CI 1.3-3.4%) at baseline. 91% of those tested positive at baseline were also antibody-positive at follow-up. While sero-prevalence increased from early November 2021 to January 2021, no indication of geospatial clustering across the city of Munich was found, although cases clustered within households. Taking baseline result and time to follow-up into account, men and participants in the age group 20-34 years were at the highest risk of sero-positivity. In the sensitivity analyses, differences in health-risk taking behaviour, number of personal contacts and leisure time activities partly explained these differences.\n\nConclusion The number of citizens in Munich with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was still below 5% during the 2nd wave of the pandemic. Antibodies remained present in the majority of baseline participants. Besides age and sex, potentially confounded by differences in behaviour, no major risk factors could be identified. Non-pharmaceutical public health measures are thus still important.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus affected almost all nations within a few weeks. Given the nature of the virus, with a large proportion of infected individuals infected present only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. Therefore, population-based sero-prevalence studies are necessary to estimate the true prevalence of the infection in the population. Starting in March 2020, such sero-prevalence studies have been conducted in many countries, mostly during or after the first wave of the pandemic (1). Depending on the serological test used, the type of sample drawn, the timing of the study, and the region, general population sero-prevalence ranged from <0.1% in Brazil to well over 20% in the USA (2). For the German context, we reported a sero-prevalence of 1.8% in Munich, sampled towards the end of the first wave in Germany (3).\n\nFollowing the introduction of public health measures (lock-down including school closures) in March 2020 in Germany, the first wave of the pandemic was perceived as relatively mild with around 6,000 cases registered in Munich during this period (Munich population \u223c1.5 Mio). Between June and October, public health measures were reduced, although physical distancing of 1.5 m between two persons, avoidance of mass events, and obligatory use of face masks, e.g. in restaurants and shops, were still required. Subsequently, officially registered monthly case numbers in Munich rose from 389 in June to 7,181 in October 2020. A partial national lock-down was implemented on November 2nd, 2020. After a further rise in officially registered case numbers and COVID-19 related deaths (Figure 1), national lock-down measures were increased from December 16th, 2020 on, including closure of schools, shops (other than grocery and drug stores), restaurants, and hotels.\n\nGiven that asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases escape surveillance systems, prospective population-based cohort studies offer the chance to better understand the course of disease in the general population. They are independent of testing strategies and help to identify the population at risk over time. In addition, they provide an indication of population groups less well protected by public health measures. We therefore followed up the participants of the Munich COVID-19 cohort (KoCo19). Besides the 1st antibody follow-up, we assessed behavioural factors by online questionnaires. The baseline study took place from April to June 2020, the questionnaire follow-up in summer 2020 and the 1st antibody follow-up was realised from early November 2020 to January 2021 (Figure 1). On December 1st 2020 the KoCo19 cohort joined the ORCHESTRA (Connecting European Cohorts to Increase Common and Effective Response to SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic) project.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy population and field work\n\nBaseline SARS-CoV-2 antibody and questionnaire study\n\nWe described the baseline study in detail in (4). In short, a random sample of the Munich population living in private households was drawn by random walk method. All household members older than 13 years were invited to provide a serum sample and to answer an online questionnaire. Serum samples were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the Elecsys\u00ae Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Roche) test (5). Field work for the baseline study took place between April 5th and June 12th, 2020.\n\nQuestionnaire follow-up\n\nAn online questionnaire covering risk behaviour, health related items, and psychosocial aspects (hereafter \u201cbehaviour questionnaire\u201d) was offered from June 4th to October 31st, 2020 to all 5,240 participants who did not withdraw from the study. In parallel, an online-questionnaire on leisure time behaviour was available (hereafter \u201cleisure time questionnaire\u201d). We split the questionnaire into two, because long questionnaires are less likely to be completed (6). Participants recruited in April (May to June) 2020 received an invitation via e-mail on June 4th (June 25th) with subsequent reminders and telephone follow-ups. In total, 3,400 participants completed the behaviour questionnaire and 1,390 participants the leisure time questionnaire.\n\n1st SARS-CoV-2 antibody follow-up\n\nOn November 2nd 2020, we started the 1st antibody follow-up by sending out boxes with a self-sampling kit to take a capillary blood samples (dry blood spot; DBS) to the 5,292 participants (2,978 households) of the baseline study (Figure 1). Between baseline and follow-up, 77 participants withdrew from the study and were thus not contacted for the follow-up. Instructions for self-sampling were provided, including a video tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpZUzuQV10E&feature=emb_title). Samples were collected using a barcode-labelled neonatal screening filter card (Euroimmun ZV 9701-0101) with circles indicating where the blood should be collected. Afterwards, participants should dry the filter card at least 12 hours at room temperature, pack them in the sealable plastic pouch, place the plastic pouch into the prepaid envelope, and ship the envelope by mail to the laboratory. In case of handling difficulties, our telephone and e-mail hotline were available for any questions.\n\nFrom November 2nd to January 31st, 2021, we received 4,444 DBS samples from 2,571 households (individual response 84%, household response 86%). Participants not being able to collect a DBS on their own (N=29) and those with intermediate results (N=34, s. laboratory methods) were offered a full-blood test at our centre. For the latter group, this served to clarify the DBS result. However, 11 of the 34 participants with intermediate results in the DBS did not show up at our centre and thus had to be excluded from analyses, leaving 4,433 subjects with baseline questionnaire, baseline serology and follow-up DBS data for the main analyses (Figure 2).\n\nQuestionnaire data\n\nThe following items were considered for the analyses presented in this paper: Baseline individual questionnaire:\n\nSocio-demographics:\n\nage, sex (male, female), schooling (<12 years, \u226512 years, in school), current job (employed, self-employed, not working (unemployed, retired, parental leave, sabbatical, students), others (voluntary social year, military service, part-time jobber, reduced working hours))\n\nCountry of birth:\n\nGermany, others\n\nSmoking:\n\ncurrent, ex, never smokers\n\nChronic conditions:\n\ndiabetes, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, respiratory diseases (yes vs no)\n\nBaseline household questionnaire:\n\nHousehold size:\n\n1, 2, 3-4, >5 inhabitants\n\nHousehold income:\n\n\u22642,500 \u20ac, 2,500-\u22644,000 \u20ac, 4,000-\u22646,000 \u20ac, >6000 \u20ac\n\nLiving area per inhabitant:\n\n\u226430 sqm, 30-\u226440 sqm, 40-\u226455 sqm, >55 sqm\n\nHousehold type:\n\nsingle, couple, family, others (shared apartments by e.g., students, subleasing, and assisted accommodation)\n\nHousing type:\n\nbuilding with 1-2 apartments, 3-4 apartments, \u2265 5 apartments\n\nFollow-up questionnaire:\n\nSelf-estimated health-related risk taking behaviour (10-level Likert scale from \u201cnot at all risk tolerant\u201d to \u201cvery risk tolerant\u201d):\n\nDichotomised into not high (\u22645, Quartile 3) and high self-estimated health-related risk taking behaviour (>5)\n\nPersonal contacts:\n\nFive questions on places of personal contacts outside the own household during the two weeks before answering the questionnaire (meeting people, grocery shopping, shopping, use of public transport, work outside home), each assessed on a 5-level Likert scale: not at all (=1); once per week (=2); 2-4 times per week (=3); 5 times per week (=4); more often (=5). Places of personal contacts were multiplied by frequency of contacts (0 contacts (=0), 1 contact (=1), 2-4 contacts (=2) and 5+ contacts (=3)) and summed up, resulting in a score ranging from 0 to 25.\n\nThe score was dichotomised into lower number of personal contacts (\u22648, Median) and higher number of personal contacts (>8).\n\nNumber and intensity of leisure time activities before the pandemic (in February 2020):\n\nFor that time, 16 activities assessed on a 5-level Likert scale from \u201cnever\u201d (=0) to \u201cvery often\u201d (=4):\n\nvisit family member; visit friends; going out with friends; attend a party, festival, bar, pub or disco; go to the cinema; attend a theatre, opera or ballet performance; work out in a gym; visit a swimming pool; visit a sauna; skiing; train for a team sport or take part in sporting competitions; watch a sports game or event live outdoors; watch a sports game or event live indoors; worship attendance; play an instrument in an orchestra; sing in a choir.\n\nActivities were multiplied by the Likert scores and summed up resulting in a score from 0 to 64. The score was dichotomised into non-high leisure time activities (\u226411, Quartile 3) and high leisure time activities (>11).\n\nNumber and intensity of leisure time activities two weeks prior to the follow-up questionnaire: The score for leisure time activities at follow-up was built the same way as the score for leisure time activities before the pandemic. However, the number of leisure time activities was only seven at that time as many activities were not possible due to the restrictions related to the pandemic:\n\nvisit family member; visit friends; going out with friends; visit a swimming pool; worship attendance; play an instrument in an orchestra; sing in a choir.\n\nTherefore, the resulting score only ranged from 0 to 28.\n\nThe score was dichotomised into non-high leisure time activities at follow-up (\u22645, Quartile 3) and high leisure time activities (>5).\n\nLaboratory method and cross-validation with blood samples\n\nFilter paper cards were further processed if at least two of the five circles on the card were completely soaked with blood. Valid samples were stored at 4 \u00b0C until analysis. Before analysis, filter paper cards were equilibrated to room temperature and three blood-soaked smaller circles (diameter 3.2 mm) of each filter paper card were automatically punched into a 96-wells plate (Panthera-Puncher(tm) 9, PerkinElmer). After elution, samples were transferred to a Cobas e801 module (Roche) compatible sample micro cup (Roche, 05085713001) for analysis using the Elecsys\u00ae Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche). Based on our validation study, DBS samples were considered positive if SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were \u22650.12. Samples with SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in the range between 0.09 and 0.12 were considered intermediate, and subsequently confirmed by plasma samples (s. Study population and field work). All other samples were considered negative. Compared to full blood samples, sensitivity of the DBS method was 99.2% and specificity 98.7%. Details of the laboratory methods are described in (7).\n\nStatistical analyses\n\nAll statistical analyses were performed using the statistical software R (version 4.0.3, R Development Core Team, 2020).\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence was estimated primarily based on the DBS test results of the study participants applying the classification as described above (Laboratory methods). If the DBS test yielded an intermediate result, we considered the result of the full blood sampling. As described in (5), an optimised cut-off of 0.4218 for the full blood sampling was used to predict SARS-CoV-2 sero-positivity with an estimated specificity and sensitivity of 99.7% and 88.6%, respectively (with regard to PCR test results considered as ground truth). We used these estimates to adjust the prevalence for the imperfect test performance (8). The specificity and sensitivity of DBS with regard to full blood samples being very high, additional adjustment was omitted (Appendix Text and Table S1).\n\nThe prevalence (adjusted or unadjusted for the specificity and the sensitivity of the test) was calculated in two different ways: including the information from the sampling design of the cohort (3) via the use of a weighting scheme, or without it. To account for the sampling design, the sampling weights computed at baseline (inverse of the probability of each individual to be included in the sample) were used for the follow-up analysis. These sampling weights were corrected for the attrition observed at follow-up by modelling the underlying non-response mechanism and estimating probabilities of response for each unit. Ten response homogeneity groups (where we assumed the non-response to be completely at random, (9)) were created using the deciles of the estimated probabilities of response. These weights adjusted for the non-response were calibrated (10) on updated information from the Munich population (at 31.12.2020) in order to mirror the age, sex, country of birth, presence of children in the household and single member household structures. Moreover, to correct the sample for the loss of positive cases at follow-up, the sampling weights were calibrated on the estimated number of positive cases at baseline. Weighted prevalence estimates were calculated using these calibrated weights, and the associated 95% confidence intervals were computed based on variance estimators based on linearization (10) and residual (10, 11) techniques. These variance estimates were computed in order to account for every step in the selection process of the units, i.e., V = V1 + V2 with V1 the variance due to the sampling design and V2 the one due to the non-response (12). For unweighted prevalence estimates, confidence intervals were determined by using a nonparametric cluster bootstrap procedure that accounts for household clustering (13). To that end, 5,000 bootstrap datasets were generated each by sampling nh households with replacement from the original sample of nh households. The sero-prevalence was estimated in each bootstrap sample and the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the resulting 5,000 estimates defined the 95% confidence intervals.\n\nTo analyse spatial clustering, we considered the mean within-cluster variance of the binary test results, with cluster variables being households, buildings, and geospatial clusters of different sizes. We performed a non-parametric approximate permutation test with 10,000 random permutations of cluster assignments. To account for household clustering, only full households were permuted when considering buildings and geospatial clusters (14). In addition to this, we performed borough level sero-prevalence mapping using Conditional Auto Regressive Models which account for the spatial autocorrelation among neighbouring boroughs by using random effects. This allowed us to investigate if sero-prevalence was associated with the population density or not, as well as obtaining Borough/District level estimates within the city of Munich (Appendix 2) (15-18).\n\nWe used generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs using the logit link function) to analyse the association between potential risk factors and SARS-CoV-2 sero-positivity at 1st follow-up, with a random effect for households to account for within household clustering of the data. Odds Ratio estimates and the corresponding confidence intervals were obtained applying a Bayesian framework with uniform priors on the regression estimates using the brms (Bayesian Regression Models using \u2018Stan\u2019) package in R (19, 20). To account for missing data in covariates, we used the Joint Analysis and Imputation of Incomplete Data Framework (JointAI) in R for sensitivity analyses (21, 22). In these sensitivity analyses, broad normal priors with mean zero and standard deviation 100 were used. The regression estimates were adjusted for the SARS-CoV-2 serology results at baseline, the time elapsed since baseline visit, age, and sex of the individual. Essentially, this adjustment for baseline positivity allowed us to obtain risk factors associated with newly incident cases within our cohort over and above the baseline positives.\n\nTo explore the importance of behavioural factors and leisure-time activities for the incidence of infection between baseline and follow-up, we used data of the 1st questionnaire follow-up combined with the DBS results. For these analyses, we included information of 2,768 participants who responded to the behaviour questionnaire and had serology results; for the leisure time activities, we had questionnaire information for 1,263 persons with serological results. Due to the large proportion of missing questionnaire data, we restricted these analyses to complete data and aggregated at the levels of the outcome variables. We analysed the incidence of new SARS-CoV-2 infections (as binomial outcome for proportions) between baseline and follow-up stratified for risk behaviour, leisure time activities, sex and age, using the count of new positives among the observed. Similar models were also applied to evaluate the association of the population densities at the constituency level and the trend in sero-prevalence estimates using aggregated data.\n\nResults\n\nFollow-up participants compared to participants lost to follow-up were more likely to be between 35 and 79 years old, born in Germany (84% vs. 74%), and to have a higher socio-economic status. The latter was indicated, e.g., by level of education, household income, living area, and type of building. In addition, the sero-prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 at baseline was lower among follow-up participants (1.6%) compared to baseline only participants (2.6%; Table 1). These losses of positive cases at follow-up led to an underestimation of the total number of people tested positive at baseline in Munich (22,064 vs. 25,900 using all participants at baseline). To correct for this attrition bias, the weights at follow-up were calibrated on the estimate of positive cases at baseline, in addition to the other margins used to mirror the Munich structure.\n\nWe received roughly half of the DBS samples (2,372 of 4,433; 54%) within 1 week of mailing (November 2nd to November 8th). By week 2 (November 9th to November 15th), more than three quarters were received (3,369 of 4,433; 76%). Most of the remaining samples were turned in between week 3 (N=372 from November 16th to November 22th) and week 4 (N=343; November 23rd to November 29th). Few samples were received in December 2020 and January 2021 (N=326; 7%).\n\nThe overall weighted and adjusted (for specificity and sensitivity) SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence at follow-up was 3.6% (95% CI 2.9-4.3%; Figure 3). The overall unweighted and adjusted sero-prevalence was 3.1% (95% CI 2.5-3.8%), increasing from 2.5% (95% CI 1.7-3.3%) in the first week of November to 4.0% (95% CI 1.6-6.8%) in the last week of November (Figure 4). About half of the participants with intermediate result in the DBS test had a positive test result when considering the plasma sample. As plasma samples were collected in December and January, the prevalence estimates in the latest weeks were artificially high. Yet, the overall upward trend remained after excluding the participants with intermediate DBS result (Appendix Figure S1, Figure S2).\n\nMost participants who were SARS-CoV-2 sero-positive at baseline continued to be sero-positive at follow-up (64 out of 70 sero-positive subjects at baseline). The weighted and adjusted SARS-CoV-2 sero-incidence (negative at baseline, positive at follow-up) was estimated at 1.6% (95% CI 0.95-2.3%) (Figure 3).\n\nLooking at the geospatial distribution of SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence by Munich city boroughs (Figure 5), an increase was visible from the South-East to the North-West of the city, although these differences were rather small. The estimates of Moran\u2019s I for spatial autocorrelation was 0.015 using the continuous distance based spatial neighbourhood matrix resulting in a p-value of 0.304, and hence was not statistically significant. Using a binary spatial neighbourhood matrix, the estimated Moran\u2019s I was 0.025 with a corresponding p-value of 0.269 - thereby the conclusion remained unchanged. We also took population density as a potential risk factor into account and could not find any statistically significant association between population density in the constituency and SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence (Appendix Figure S3).\n\nThe distribution of SARS-CoV-2 sero-positivity by covariates is shown in the Appendix (Table S3). Taking household clustering, time elapsed between baseline and follow-up, and baseline result into account, men had statistically significantly higher odds of sero-positivity at follow-up (OR adjusted for age: 2.4; 95% CI 1.0-6.0; Figure 6). In addition, SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence decreased with increasing age group. It was lower in participants living in small apartment houses compared to participants living in single houses (OR adjusted for age and sex 0.0002; 95% CI 0.0-0.14).\n\nThe analysis of potential household and neighbourhood clustering indicated a highly significant within-household clustering, while no indications for neighbourhood transmission were observed (Figure 7, Appendix Figure S5).\n\nSensitivity analyses on behavioural factors and SARS-CoV-2 sero-incidence\n\nIn order to identify which behavioural factors might be related to the different sero-prevalences in men and younger subjects, we compared these factors by sex and age group. The self-estimated health-related risk taking behaviour, sum of contacts and leisure-time activities decreased significantly by age in men and women (p<0.001; Appendix Table S4). The decrease in self-estimated health-related risk taking behaviour was most pronounced for age groups <35 yrs and 35-64 yrs, while number of contacts and leisure-time activities were substantially reduced in the oldest age group. Comparing men and women, self-estimated health-related risk taking behaviour was statistically higher for men than for women in the age group 35-65 yrs only (p<0.001, Appendix Table S5). In contrast, sum of contacts and number of leisure time activities was similar for men and women by age strata (p>0.05).\n\nIn order to check for effect modification by sex, age and behavioural factors, we calculated the sex- and age-stratified SARS-CoV-2 sero-incidence between baseline and follow-up by self-estimated health-related risk taking behaviour (Figure 8A), number of contacts outside own household (Figure 8B), number of leisure time activities in summer 2020 (Figure 8C). These data indicate a slightly higher risk of infection among men and women above the age of 34 years who indicated to have a high health-related risk taking behaviour compared to those with no high health-related risk taking behaviour. Men and women above the age of 64 years showed a higher SARS-CoV-2 sero-incidence if they had more personal contacts compared to participants having fewer personal contacts. Men with more leisure time activities in summer 2020 had a higher SARS-CoV-2 sero-incidence compared to less active men. However, all confidence intervals largely overlapped.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur data indicate a low SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence for the Munich general population living in private households eight months after the start of the pandemic. The incidence between the end of the first wave and the middle of the second wave was about as high as the related number of infections acquired during the first wave. Almost all sero-positive participants at baseline remained sero-positive at follow-up, indicating a high validity of the antibody test. Additionally, this supports previous reports suggesting that the humoral SARS-CoV-2 immune response is stable at least over the first eight months after infection (23, 24). We also showed a predominance in SARS-CoV-2 sero-positivity among male compared to female participants, and a reduced antibody prevalence with increasing age group.\n\nBased on our data, the sero-prevalence for the Munich population above the age of 13 years living in private households was 3.6% (95% CI 2.9-4.3%). Until the end of November 2020, a total of 30,180 SARS-CoV-2 cases were officially registered in Munich (https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/Stadtinfos/Coronavirus-Fallzahlen.html#Fallzahlen; Access date: 19-April-2021) which results in a population prevalence of 1.9%. This prevalence increased to 44,377 registered cases by the end of December 2020 (population prevalence 3.0%). The data are not directly comparable, as the official data also include children and persons living in institutions. While the prevalence of infection in children was at that time considered to be smaller than in adults, it was unknown for people living in institutions (e.g., homes for the elderly). Nevertheless, the comparison gives an indication that the percentage of officially registered infections improved considerably compared to the beginning of the pandemic. In a previous publication we estimated that solely one out of four infections was registered by the official infectious diseases surveillance system (3). A few population-based SARS-CoV-2 sero-studies have been conducted since the beginning of the pandemic (for review see (2)), most of them reporting sero-prevalences during or after the first wave. Up to now, only the Spanish national study reported the results of their follow-up data (25) with a sero-prevalence at follow-up (November 2020) of 5%, and thus comparable to our results.\n\nIn our study, one predictor of change in sero-prevalence from baseline to follow-up was male sex. While a higher risk of more severe COVID-19 among men was confirmed in several studies (26), findings on sex-differences in sero-prevalence are still inconsistent (2). As younger age was also related to a larger increase in SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence at follow-up, one might assume that differences in behaviour may contribute to these findings. We could confirm differences in health-risk taking behaviour, frequency of leisure-time activities, and number of contacts outside the own household especially by age. In the stratified analyses of the incidence of infection by age and sex, we observed a tendency that behaviour is related to higher sero-incidence of infection; although the low incidence and the reduced number of respondents to the questionnaires limited the statistical power of these analyses and result interpretation has to be done cautiously. However, the hypothesis that specific behaviour, i.e., restriction of contacts, might reduce the risk of infection is also supported by our observation that patients with autoimmune disease were at reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 sero-positivity. This finding is in line with studies among, e.g., patients with inflammatory bowel disease (27). Overall, our findings support the notion that behavioural factors contribute to the spread of the pandemic, and therefore actions to increase adherence to public-health measures (such as information campaigns) are crucial especially in a time when acceptance of measures in the general population is faltering.\n\nOur results also confirm the importance of household clustering while no indications for neighbourhood clustering were seen. The former finding is also supported by the observation that participants from higher income households were at non-significantly higher odds of SARS-CoV-2 sero-positivity. As we took into account total household income (not adjusted for number of persons in the household), single households were more likely to be in the lower income category and thus, at lower likelihood of household transmission.\n\nWe also saw a non-significant trend for lower odds of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in smokers compared to non-smokers (OR 0.2; 95% CI 0.02-1.1), confirming results of a meta-analysis (28). Here, differences were mainly explained by differences in testing behaviour between smokers and non-smokers, which can be excluded in our study. One of the population-based studies published so far also indicated a lower SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence in smokers compared to non-smokers (29). Whether this is a true effect of, e.g., nicotine (30) or vitamin D (31) or result of some form of bias needs to be evaluated in future studies. Of note is also the tendency for higher odds of SARS-CoV-2 in participants pursuing school, however, the wide confidence interval does not permit strong conclusions.\n\nAmong the strengths of our study are its population-based, prospective nature in a large number of participants. Such population-based studies help authorities to plan public health measures based on the prevalence of exposure in the population, its spatial distribution and to further identify risk groups (32). With increasing availability of vaccines, this study design with further follow-ups will help public health authorities to understand the extent and duration of vaccine-induced immunity (33). We previously showed a high sensitivity and specificity of the Elecsys\u00ae Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche) used in this sero-study (5). For the follow-up, we developed and carefully validated a semi-automated protocol using self-sampled DBS for SARS-CoV-2 serology (7). This approach facilitates field work to a very considerable extent and thus, makes studies with a higher frequency of follow-ups more feasible. Acceptance was high in our study population, and the percentage of participants lost to follow-up comparably low.\n\nHowever, in the analyses we had to take selective participation into account by modelling the underlying non-response mechanism and calibrating the weights. This way, we could reduce attrition bias in our prevalence and incidence estimates. It is common in prospective cohort studies that baseline participants in younger age groups, with migration background and with lower socio-economic status are less likely to participate at follow-up (4). While typically participants with positive outcome are also more likely to participate in follow-up studies (34), our baseline participants who were SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive were less likely to take part at follow-up. This gives some indication that unknown sero-status motivated at least part of our baseline participants to take part in the study. Once positive sero-status was known to them, they might have lost interest. Further supported is this hypothesis by the fact that less participants were willing to complete the follow-up questionnaires than to take part in the SARS-CoV-2 antibody follow-up. As a consequence, statistical power to analyse the association between behavioural factor and SARS-CoV-2 sero-positivity was limited.\n\n# Variables to Extract\n1.

Methods We sought a representative sample of Connecticut residents, ages \\xe2\\x89\\xa518 years and residing in noncongregate settings, who completed a survey between June 4 and June 23, 2020, and underwent serology testing for SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies between June 10 and July 29, 2020. We also oversampled non-Hispanic black and Hispanic subpopulations. We estimated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies and the prevalence of symptomatic illness and self-reported adherence to risk-mitigation behaviors among this population. Results Of the 567 respondents (mean age 50 [\\xc2\\xb1 17] years; 53% women; 75% non-Hispanic white individuals) included at the state level, 23 respondents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, resulting in weighted seroprevalence of 4.0 (90% confidence interval [CI] 2.0-6.0). The weighted seroprevalence for the oversampled non-Hispanic black and Hispanic populations was 6.4% (90% CI 0.9-11.9) and 19.9% (90% CI 13.2-26.6), respectively. The majority of respondents at the state level reported following risk-mitigation behaviors: 73% avoided public places, 75% avoided gatherings of families or friends, and 97% wore a facemask, at least part of the time. Conclusions These estimates indicate that the vast majority of people in Connecticut lack antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and there is variation by race and ethnicity. There is a need for continued adherence to risk-mitigation behaviors among Connecticut residents to prevent resurgence of COVID-19 in this region. Clinical Significance Our results show that despite Connecticut having an early outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a majority of people in Connecticut lack detectable antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and, as such, remain vulnerable to infection. There is continued need for strong public health efforts encouraging Connecticut residents to continue adherence to risk-mitigation behaviors so as to prevent resurgence of the virus in the region. Alt-text: Unlabelled box Introduction Connecticut was one of the first states in the United States to be severely affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with its first confirmed case of COVID-19 in early March. While almost 43,000 cases and 4000 deaths were reported by June, a seroprevalence study, which estimates the percentage of people with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies, may provide a more accurate estimate of the percentage of Connecticut population with evidence of a prior infection from COVID-19. Prior seroprevalence studies have estimated the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. However, the majority have taken advantage of blood samples collected for other reasons or used a convenience sample, which limits their representativeness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted a seroprevalence survey in Connecticut using blood specimens collected at commercial laboratories. However, these specimens were produced as part of routine or sick visits, representing a biased sample. Moreover, this effort did not provide the reason for the blood collection or information about recent symptomatic illness, underlying conditions, or relevant risk-mitigation behaviors, which may help predict detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, with support from the Connecticut Department of Public Health (DPH) and the CDC, we conducted the Post-Infection Prevalence (PIP) Study, a public health surveillance project to determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among adults residing in community noncongregate settings in Connecticut before June. Specifically, we sought to understand prior spread at the state level; collect information about symptomatic illness, risk factors for virus infection, and self-reported adherence to risk-mitigation behaviors; compare our seroprevalence estimates to available Connecticut estimates; and provide targeted estimates for the non-Hispanic black and Hispanic populations. Methods Study Cohort For the state-level seroprevalence estimate, from June 4 to June 23, 2020, we enrolled 735 adults residing in noncongregate settings (ie, excluding individuals living in long-term care facilities, assisted living facilities, nursing homes, and prisons or jails) in Connecticut, ages \\xe2\\x89\\xa518 years, using a dual-frame Random Digit Dial (RDD) methodology. Additionally, from June 23 to July 22, 2020, we oversampled non-Hispanic black (n\\xe2\\x80\\xaf=\\xe2\\x80\\xaf269) and Hispanic (n\\xe2\\x80\\xaf=\\xe2\\x80\\xaf341) individuals to provide more accurate estimates for these subpopulations. Details of the sample size calculation and RDD methodology are described in eMethods 1, available online. Details of participant recruitment are described in eMethods 2, available online. We contacted a total of 7305 respondents at the state level and successfully completed 735 interviews. We contacted a total of 12,508 respondents for the oversampled subpopulations, of whom 457 completed interviews. The study was deemed not to be research by the institutional review board at Yale University because of the public health surveillance activity exclusion and was approved by the institutional review board at Gallup. Survey Components Individuals selected were provided study details, and informed consent was obtained from all participants by trained interviewers. Participants were interviewed using a questionnaire that collected information on demographics, social determinants of health, history of influenza-like-illness, symptoms experienced, and other COVID-19-related topics. The average survey time was 15 minutes. Specimen Collection and Serology Testing Within 24-48 hours of completing the interview, respondents were contacted to schedule their blood draw appointment at their nearest Quest Diagnostics Patient Service Center (PSC). Up to 5 attempts were made to each household where the participant agreed to be tested. On confirmation that the participant had completed the test, an incentive payment of $50 was sent as a gift card via email or mail. Beginning July 17, 2020, we offered participants an additional $50 (for a total compensation of $100) to incentivize completion of the serology test.

Of the total 341 Hispanic and 269 non-Hispanic black participants enrolled for the oversample estimate, 171 and 148 participants, respectively, completed serology testing (eFigure 2 , available online). The distribution of the timing of the blood draws is shown in eFigure 3 , available online. Sera were obtained from samples collected in BD Hemogard serum separator tubes. All samples were processed at the Quest Diagnostics Marlborough Laboratory. Samples were run at room temperature using the primary collection tube. We measured immunoglobulin G (IgG) SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Vitros anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test, which detects antibodies against the spike glycoprotein of the virus. Antibody levels were expressed as the ratio of the chemiluminescence signal over the cutoff value, with a value \\xe2\\x89\\xa51.00 reported as positive. The Ortho Vitros IgG test had a reported sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 100%, respectively. We validated the sensitivity of this test in a small subset of patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (n\\xe2\\x80\\xaf=\\xe2\\x80\\xaf36) with variable disease severity, using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing as the gold standard.  Additionally, given the concern about the accuracy of serology tests, we retested the negative samples from 5 high-risk cities of Connecticut (ie, Bridgeport, Hartford, New Haven, Stamford, and Waterbury) with the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG test that detects antibodies aimed at a different SARS-CoV-2 antigen (nucleocapsid protein).  Finally, Quest Diagnostics provided results for all SARS-CoV-2 serology tests conducted throughout Connecticut in the same time period (ie, June 10 and July 29, 2020) for comparison. Statistical Analysis The sample data were weighted to approximate the Connecticut population (details described in eMethods 3, available online). Briefly, the base weight assigned to each completed survey was derived as the product of the inverse of the probability of selection and nonresponse adjustment. Next, poststratification weighting adjustments were made to account for residual nonresponse and to match the weighted sample estimates to known population characteristics for Connecticut. Poststratification weighting for the state-level sample was carried out using ranking (or Iterative Proportional Fitting) procedures to adjust for age, gender, race or ethnicity, and education. The categories chosen for weighting the oversample subpopulations were different from what was used for the state-level adjustments due to lower available sample sizes. To reduce the effect of extreme weights on sampling variance, final weights were trimmed. The margin of error (MOE) for this study was calculated at the 90% confidence level (CI) taking into consideration the design effect introduced by variability of weights on each survey estimate. Overall study design effect as estimated by the Kish approximation equals 1.83; however, it varies by each survey estimate. Next, the unweighted seroprevalence was calculated for both the overall state-level sample and the oversampled non-Hispanic black and Hispanic subgroups. Finally, we estimated the weighted state-level seroprevalence and the MOE of these estimates, both overall and for subgroups with sufficient sample size. Subgroups with sample sizes < 30 were too small to calculate accurate estimates and were thus not reported. We also estimated the MOE at 95% CI for the state-level estimates as a secondary outcome. We reported the weighted seroprevalence for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic subgroups separately. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 24.0 (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, Ill.) and R version 4.0.2. We considered 2-sided P values < 0.05 as statistically significant.

Comparison of the unweighted demographic distribution of individuals who completed only the survey with those who completed both the survey and the antibody test has been provided in eTable 1, available online. Although the 2 groups were not significantly different in regional representation, a significantly higher number of younger, Hispanic and non-Hispanic black individuals did not complete blood testing. However, our weighted study sample was closer to the target sample in the distribution of subgroups by age, sex, race and ethnicity, education level, and health insurance (Table 1, available online).

As shown in Table 2 , fever, cough, sore throat, diarrhea, and new loss of taste or smell was reported by 9%, 18%, 10%, 16%, and 5% respondents, respectively, at some point between March and June. About 16% of individuals reported being tested for coronavirus previously, and of these, 12% reported testing positive. The majority of respondents reported following risk-mitigation practices, at least some of the time, since March, with 73% reporting having avoided public places and 75% reporting having avoided gatherings of family and friends. Notably, 97% of respondents reported wearing a mask outside their home at least part of the time. About 31% of all respondents reported having worked from home at least part of the time, representing 57% of working respondents.

Overall, 23 respondents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, yielding a weighted seroprevalence of 4.0% (90% CI 2.0-6.0). Among individuals who reported having symptomatic illness, those with fever, cough, sore throat, and diarrhea had a weighted seroprevalence of 32.4% (90% CI 15.1-49.7), 11.4% (90% CI 2.8-20.0), 10.3% (90% CI 0.0-21.0), and 6.9% (90% CI 0.0-14.4), respectively. Among the 25 individuals who reported loss of taste or smell, 14 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Asymptomatic individuals had significantly lower weighted seroprevalence 0.6% (90% CI 0.0-1.3) compared with the overall state estimate, whereas those with \\xe2\\x89\\xa5 1 and \\xe2\\x89\\xa5 2 symptoms had a seroprevalence of 11.3% (90% CI 5.4-17.2) and 16.1% (90% CI 4.9-27.3), respectively (Table 3). The comparisons between other subgroups and the state estimates are presented in eTable 3, available online. Additionally, seroprevalence estimates at 95% MOE have also been shown in eTable 3, available online. Among the 143 negative samples from 5 high-risk cities in Connecticut that were retested with Abbott Architect serology assay, 142 (99.3%) samples tested negative. Additionally, of the total 25,274 antibody tests conducted by Quest Diagnostics in Connecticut during this time period, 2072 (8.4%) samples tested positive. Of the 11 respondents who reported testing positive for coronavirus, all tested positive for antibodies.
