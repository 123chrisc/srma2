Introduction
Primary hyperaldosteronism (PA) is now recognized as the most common cause of secondary hypertension [1]. Aldosterone excess leads to cardiac and renal dysfunction in a greater extent than the observed in essential hypertensive (EHT) patients, increasing morbidity and mortality [2,3,4,5]. Targeted treatment with lifelong mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) or unilateral adrenalectomy are the expert consensus recommendations for PA management. Blood pressure (BP) normalization and correction of hypokalemia are not the only goals of the treatment of PA, an effective prevention on related target-organ damage is also needed. A recent meta-analysis [6] demonstrated a higher risk of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and stroke in untreated PA compared to EHT patients. Nevertheless, conflicting results have been reported regarding the efficacy of adrenalectomy compared to MRA for preventing cardiovascular and metabolic events in patients with PA. On one hand, some studies reported lower rates of new onset atrial fibrillation in surgically treated PA patients as compared to medically treated [7,8,9] as well as a greater improvement in quality of life [10] and a lower risk of incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) [11]. Moreover, recently, a meta-analysis [12] reported a lower risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with PA treated by surgery, but not in medically treated compared to EHT patients. Contrarily, other studies, including prospective series, did not find any difference between surgically and medically treated PA patients in terms of cardiovascular [13, 14], metabolic [15], or renal [16] outcomes.
The aim of our study was to analyze the short-term cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic outcomes in patients with PA followed up either after adrenalectomy or treatment with MRA in monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs.
Methods
Patients
Patients with a diagnosis of PA who were in follow-up in the period between 2018 and 2020 in twelve Spanish tertiary hospitals were included in this study. Follow-up time was defined as the time between the date of the diagnosis and the date of the last available visit (in months). The period covered from the year 2000 to 2021. A total of 329 patients have been included in the Spanish Primary Aldosteronism Registry of the Spanish Endocrinology and Nutrition Society (SEEN) (SPAIN-ALDO Registry) at the time of the analysis of this study (20th October 2021). For this study, only patients who underwent adrenalectomy or were under medical treatment with MRA, and had clinical, hormonal, and biochemical information during follow-up were included (n_=_268). Patients with confirmed co-secretion of cortisol (cortisol post-dexamethasone suppression test >5.0_Âµg/dL) (n_=_3), not treated by surgery neither with MRA or with unavailable clinical, biochemical, and hormonal information during follow-up (n_=_58) were excluded (Fig. 1). The study was approved by the local ethics committee of the RamÃ³n y Cajal University Hospital (approval date: 10th November 2020, code: ACTA 401).


Clinical evaluation and definitions
Data about demographic factors (age, sex, and smoking habits), comorbidities such as hypertension (grade based on ESC 2018 Classification [17], duration, family history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, dyslipidemia, CKD, LVH, sleep apnea syndrome, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events have been recorded. Moreover, further data about medical treatment with antihypertensive (type, number, and doses), oral antidiabetic and lipid-lowering medications, potassium supplements, insulin and antiplatelet agents was registered. Data about physical evaluation as office measurements of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and body mass index (BMI (kg/m2)) were included. All variables were measured in the outpatient clinic and data were collected from the moment of the diagnosis of PA to the last available visit during follow-up as registered in clinical records.
We defined CKD as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR)_<_60_mL/min/1.73_m2 (GFR was estimated with the modification of diet in renal disease formula (MDRD-4)) for a period of more than 3 months [18]. Cardiovascular disease was classified in six different groups: ischemic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, and/or valvular heart disease. Cerebrovascular disease included ischemic and/or hemorrhagic stroke and transient ischemic attack. We defined cardiometabolic comorbidities as type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, and obesity.
PA was diagnosed based on the criteria proposed by the current clinical European guidelines of PA [19, 20]: a positive case detection based on a pathological plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC)/plasma renin activity (PRA) ratio or PAC/plasma renin concentration (PRC) ratio and at least one positive result in a confirmatory test. Most centers applied a cutoff of 30 for PAC (ng/dL)/PRA (ng/ml/h) and 3.7 for PAC (ng/dl)/PRC (mU/L), but some centers used a lower cutoff of 1.8 when PRC was measured by chemiluminescence assays. Dynamic tests were performed in 164 patients (95 saline infusion test, 55 captopril test, and 14 oral sodium loading test). The other 104 patients did not undergo confirmatory tests as they presented with spontaneous hypokalemia, plasma renin below detection levels and PAC_>_20_ng/dL. PAC, PRA, and PRC determinations were performed after withdrawal of antihypertensive drugs that might interfere with the results for at least 2 weeks before testing and after oral potassium supplementation if plasma potassium was <3.5_mEq/L.
CT and/or MRI were performed in all patients at diagnosis, but information about imaging characteristics was not available in four patients. Furthermore, (6_-131I) iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol scintigraphy was evaluated in 53 patients. Adrenal vein sampling (AVS) was performed in 99 patients (with cosyntropin stimulation in 60 cases, unstimulated in 39 patients). In 46 cases, both adrenal veins were correctly catheterized. Based on radiological (CT/MRI) studies, AVS and surgical outcomes, 111 patients were classified as unilateral disease and 157 as bilateral. The diagnosis of unilaterality was based on the combination of one or more of the following criteria: i) Successful AVS (plasma cortisol concentrations were at least two (without ACTH stimulation) or three times (with ACTH stimulation) higher in both adrenal veins compared with peripheral vein) and positive lateralization ratio (aldosterone/cortisol ratio between both adrenal veins >2 if AVS was performed without ACTH stimulation and >3 when ACTH stimulation was used) (n_=_25), ii) overt PA in patients <40 years with a unilateral adrenal nodule >10_mm (n_=_16) and/or iii) biochemical and/or hypertension resolution after adrenalectomy (n_=_94).
The definitions of biochemical and clinical cure for PA after adrenalectomy were based on the PASO classification system [21]: i) complete (normokalemia and normalization of the aldosterone/renin ratio), ii) partial (normokalemia but persistence of abnormal aldosterone/renin ratio) and iii) no biochemical cure (persistence of hipokalemia and abnormal aldosterone/renin ratio); and i) complete (normal BP with no antihypertensive medications), ii) partial (reduction or unchanged BP with less medication or reduction in BP with same amount of medication) and iii) no clinical cure (unchanged or increase levels of BP and/or the same or an increased amount of antihypertensive medications).
Laboratory test
Data have been collected on fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol, HDL-c, LDL-c, triglycerides, serum creatinine, uric acid, GFR (MDR-4), microalbuminuria, proteinuria, sodium, and serum potassium, at the initial and the last visit in the Hypertension/Endocrinology Unit. Measurement of PAC and PRA or PRC was performed in all patients at diagnosis. PAC and PRC was measured by chemiluminescence assays in most centers; and PRA by radioimmunoassays.
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was performed with STATA 15. Data for continuous variables were expressed as mean_Â±_standard deviation or median and (interquartile range (IQR)) and as percentages (and absolute values) for categorical variables. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to probe the normality assumption and Leveneâs test to checked homogeneity of variances. The student t test was used to compare quantitative variables and the X2 test for qualitative variables between two groups. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CI through follow-up were calculated from Cox regression analyses. An actuarial method (life-table method) was used for the estimation of the failure curve (using intervals of 6 months, cardiometabolic comorbidities development was considered failure). Failure curves between the group of surgery and MRA were compared with the MantelâCox test. The level of P_<_0.05 or an CI of the HR not included 1.0 were considered statistically significant.

Results
Baseline characteristics
111 patients with confirmed unilateral PA and 157 with bilateral PA were included in the study. No cases of hereditary PA were included. Adrenalectomy was performed in 100 patients (in 74 patients with confirmed diagnosis of unilateral PA, but only 25 patients underwent adrenalectomy based on AVS results). The remaining patients were treated with MRA in monotheraphy or in combination with other antyhypertensive drugs (n_=_168). Spironolactone was the drug of choice in 106 (median doses 50_mg/day (range 12.5â300)) and in 62 eplerenone (median doses 50_mg/day (range 25â200_mg/day)). The doses of MRA were titrated based on BP control_Â±_PRA/PRC and patient tolerance during follow-up. At baseline, patients treated with surgery were more commonly women, had a higher prevalence of hypokalemia and lower of obesity than patients treated with MRA. Moreover, GFR and LDL-c levels were higher in patients that underwent surgery than those medically treated. Before the diagnostic phase was initiated, more PA patients of the medically treated group than of the adrenalectomy group were treated with MRA (Table 1). The most frequent types of cardiovascular diseases at diagnosis were hypertensive heart disease (13.7%) and ischemic heart disease (9.3%).

Blood pressure and biochemical outcomes
Of the 100 patients treated by surgery, 42 achieved complete biochemical and partial clinical cure; 41 complete biochemical and clinical cure; 11 complete biochemical cure with no clinical response, and in six patients any kind of improvement was observed after surgery, neither biochemical nor in BP. Overall, complete biochemical cure was obteined in 94.0% and clinical response in 83.0%. After a median follow-up of 23.6 months (IQR 9.7â53.8) (mean follow-up 42.2_Â±_53.43), there was a similar improvement in SBP and DBP in both surgically and medically treated patients and a similar rate of patients treated with surgery and MRA treatment had BP values <140/90_mmHg at last visit (82.5% vs 77.2%, P_=_0.402) (Table 2). However, the improved BP was attained with less antihypertensive medications in the surgical group compared to the medical one (âantihypertensive drugs: _1.3_Â±_1.3 vs 0.0_Â±_1.4, P_<_0.0001). At the last follow-up visit, levels of serum potasium have been more increased in surgically treated after surgery than in patients under MRA treatmnet. PAC decreased more in surgically than medically treated patients (Table 2).

Cardiovascular, renal and metabolic outcomes
During the observational period, in general, no differences were observed in the incidence of new onset cardiometabolic and renal comorbidities between the groups treated by surgery or MRA (HR 0.9 [0.5â1.5], P_=_0.717). Neither in the risk of individual comorbities nor their grade of control (Table 2 and Fig. 2). No differences were observed after adjusting by the prevalence of obesity and GFR at diagnosis either (for the composite outcome: HR_=_0.9 [0.5â1.6]; for incident type 2 diabetes: HR 1.1 [0.2â5.0]; dyslipidemia: HR 1.2 [0.4â3.8]; cardiovascular events: HR 0.7 [0.1â3.4]; CKD: HR 0.9 [0.4â2.1], sleep apnea syndrome: HR 2.7 [0.2â30.4]).

Discussion
We found that in patients with PA, both surgical and medical therapy improved BP and biochemical control, with similar short-term cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic outcomes. However, surgery led to an easier BP control with lower requirement of antihypertensive medications and a higher increased in serum potassium levels.
In our study, adrenalectomy resulted in complete biochemical cure in 94.0% of the cases and clinical response in 83.0% (hypertension cure in 41.0% and BP improvement in 42.0%). These results are in accordance with the reported in other previous studies describing aldosterone/renin ratio and hypokalemia normalization in 90â100% of the patients and hypertension resolution in 30â50% [22,23,24]. However, higher rates of hypertension cure have been reported by other authors, describing clinical resolution in up to 84.5% of the patients [25]. It is important to highlight that although biochemical cure was reported in 94% of patients, clinical cure only occurred in 41% of the patients in our study. Some reasons that could explain the low rate of hypertension cure despite the high rate of biochemical cure may be related to the coexistence of several predictors of hypertension failure in our cohort [22, 23, 26]. In this sense, 37% of the patients who underwent adrenalectomy were obese, and several studies suggested that increased BMI at baseline is a potential predictor of incomplete or absent clinical success after adrenalectomy in PA [22]. Another predictive factor that has been recognized as one of the main factors associated with hypertension persistence after surgery is the presence of a concomitant essential hypertension [23]. This is expected to be more common with advanced age and/or longer duration of the hypertension, so the coexistence of essential hypertension might also play a role in the low rate of hypertension cure finding in our cohort as the mean duration of the hypertension in PA patients underwent adrenalectomy was close to 10 years. We are also aware that adrenalectomy was not guided by AVS in most of the patients (only 25% of the cases). The discordance between the biochemical-clinical cure found supports the hypothesis that the persistence of hypertension after surgery in PA could be explained in a high proportion of patients by the coexistence of EHT and / or irreversible vascular remodeling in the arterioles [26].

We observed that surgery led to an easier BP control and higher potassium levels compared to MRA lowering the burden of the medication. Most of the published studies reported similar results [27, 28]. Therefore, Marzano et al. meta-analysis [27] observed a reduction in BP medications only after surgery (2.1 vs 1.0), but not in the MRA group (2.1 vs 2.1). Other more recent metanalysis focused on the same aim [29], also reported a greater decrease in the number of oral antihypertensive agents in adrenalectomized patients than in the MRA group. Moreover, a prospective study of 110 patients treated by adrenalectomy and 70 with medical therapy [28] found that, after a median follow-up of 36 months, BP was lowered to similar values in adrenalectomized (135_Â±_15/83_Â±_9_mmHg) and medically treated PA (133_Â±_11/83_Â±_7_mmHg). However, adrenalectomized patients required significantly less drugs (1.76_Â±_1.37) than medically treated patients (2.73_Â±_1.27). As an important point, in these three mentioned studies, as in our study, despite the easier and/or better BP control in surgically than medically treated patients, no difference in the reduced incidence of cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease was observed. In relation to this finding, it is important to point out that the degree of renin suppression is an important factor to consider in terms of cardiometabolic outcomes as it reflects the grade of aldosterone blockade, and it is usually not reported in most studies that compared both strategies. Both in patients under MRA and those who have been adrenalectomized, renin levels should remain unsuppressed reflecting and adequate control or resolution of the PA, respectively [30]. There are other previous studies that have pointed out the importance of the degree of renin suppression in patients with PA treated medically in terms of cardiovascular outcomes [31, 32]. In this sense, Hundemer et al. [31] found that PA patients whose renin activity remained suppressed (<1_Âµg/L/h) on MRAs had a higher risk for cardiovascular events and mortality than patients with EHT, whereas PA patients who had unsuppressed renin (â¥1_Âµg/L/h) had no significant excess risk compared to EHT patients. Another study that has highlighted the importance of the grade of aldosterone blockade with MRA on cardiovascular outcomes found that patients with suppressed PRC had no decrease in pro-BNP levels, and the reduction of LVH was less intense than in patients with unsuppressed PRC (P_=_0.033) or after adrenalectomy (P_=_0.019) [32]. As it is known that the changes of plasma renin and aldosterone during treatment with MRAs is dose-dependent [33], the MRA dose should be increased progressively to obtain non-suppressed levels of plasma renin, with the aim of optimize cardiovascular outcomes. Thus, our hypothesis is that studies that have not found differences in cardiometabolic outcomes, including ours, might have comparable renin levels in PA treated by unilateral adrenalectomy and with medical MRA treatment, but studies that have found differences between both treatment strategies might not achieved renin goals with MRA.
In the current study, the composite risk of cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic events including type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, and chronic kidney disease, was similar for surgical and medical therapy. Thus, although mounting evidence suggests that the removal of the unilateral aldosteronoma may result in superior reduction of the cardiovascular risk and quality of life when compared with medical therapy with MRA [34, 35] and that long-term exposure to increased aldosterone levels might result in cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic sequelae that occur independently of the BP level [15, 36, 37], intriguingly, several authors have not found differences in the incidence of cardiometabolic events between patients treated with MRA and surgery [13, 16, 27]. Among these studies, in one of them [13] patients were prospectively followed up for a mean of 7.4 years after adrenalectomy or treatment with spironolactone, and no differences were found in the incidence of cardiovascular events between both groups. In the Marzano et al meta-analysis [27], 355 patients with PA who had an average follow-up of 4.0 years after unilateral adrenalectomy (n_=_178) or treatment with MRA (n_=_177) were analyzed, and despite greater effect of surgery over medical treatment in reducing BP, no difference in the reduction of LVH was demonstrated. Nevertheless, a more recent meta-analysis that included a total of 6148 PA patients demonstrated a lower incidence of composite cardiovascular outcomes among PA patients who underwent surgical treatment over medical treatment (OR 0.49 [0.30â0.80]), but there was a significant heterogeneity among the studies [I (2) = 82%, p_<_0.00001] enrolled in this meta-analysis. Thus, although theoretically, both MRA and surgery can potentially correct the effects of aldosterone excess since MR blockade has also been shown to revert LVH in patients with EHT [38], and improve variables of diastolic function in hypertensive patients with diastolic heart failure [39]. It is possible that other factors besides aldosterone may contribute to the higher cardiometabolic risk in patients with PA [40]. Supporting this theory, Arlt et al. [40] found that patients with PA had significantly increased cortisol and total glucocorticoid metabolite excretion (P_<_0.001), even higher than in patients with autonomous cortisol secretion, and that several surrogate parameters of metabolic risk correlated significantly with glucocorticoid but not mineralocorticoid output. So, an additional glucocorticoid-opposing treatment should be provided for PA patients in addition to MRA treatment, in order to reduce the potential risks of developing cardiovascular diseases and other comorbidities. Surgery offers the chance to reverse both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid excess. Our hypothesis is that the differences in the reported studies regarding the reduction or not in the cardiometabolic and renal risk in treated with surgery and MRA could be in part explained by the different study population, since it is known that some factors such as age and obesity can affect the evolution of the cardiometabolic profile. Moreover, the different degree of renin and BP control with MRA and the different obtained outcomes with surgery can affect the evolution of the cardiometabolic and renal profile [41]. In addition, we are aware that two-years of follow-up is hardly sufficient time to measure incident cardiovascular events with our sample size. Thus, it would be expected that with a longer follow-up period, differences in the cardiometabolic profile were evident in favor to adrenalectomy vs medical treatment.
Our study has several limitations. Firstly, not all patients had undergone AVS to formally subtype their disease and the decision of adrenalectomy. It is known that AVS is the gold standard for the location study in PA, and CT/MRI and nor cholesterol studies may lead to equivocal results in up to 30â40% [42] and 50% [43] of the cases, respectively. Thus, this fact could explain the lower rate of complete clinical response observed in our cohort study, reducing the probability to find differences in BP and biochemical outcomes between the MRA and surgery group. However, almost 95% of the patients presented biochemical cure, suggesting that the diagnosis of unilaterality in adrenalectomized patients was corrected. Considering that aldosterone excess is the main driver of the detrimental cardiovascular and metabolic profile in PA, it is not expected that the criteria employed for the unilaterality selection in our study could had affected the observed results in the cardiovascular outcomes after treatment. However, the event rate of incident cardiovascular and metabolic disease during follow-up was low, so it is possible that a type II statistical error had took place in our study. Moreover, we are aware of the limitations of a retrospective study, and that the follow-up time was short, and the small number of operated patients included in the register at the time of the analysis study.

Conclusions
In patients with PA, MRA and surgery offer a similar cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal protection, in a short-term follow-up, but surgery improves biochemical control and reduces pill burden more commonly than MRA, leading to hypertension cure or improvement in up to 83% of the patients. For this reason, at the moment, surgery should continue be considered the first-line treatment in patients with unilateral PA. Future studies including monitoring of renin are expected to evaluate the MRA therapy response in PA patients."

Abstract
Background  Experimental and human studies demonstrate that long-term exposure to elevated aldosterone levels results in cardiac and vascular damage.
Methods  We investigated long-term cardiovascular outcomes in patients with primary aldosteronism after surgical or medical treatment. Fifty-four patients with or without evidence of adrenal adenomas were prospectively followed up for a mean of 7.4 years after treatment with adrenalectomy or spironolactone. Patients with primary aldosteronism were compared with patients with essential hypertension and were treated to reach a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg. The main outcome measure was a combined cardiovascular end point comprising myocardial infarction, stroke, any type of revascularization procedure, and sustained arrhythmias.
Results  At baseline, the prevalence of cardiovascular events was greater in primary aldosteronism (35%) than in essential hypertension (11%) (odds ratio, 4.61; 95% confidence interval, 2.38-8.95; P < .001), with odds ratios of 4.93, 4.36, and 2.80 for sustained arrhythmias, cerebrovascular events, and coronary heart disease, respectively. Blood pressure during follow-up was comparable in the primary aldosteronism and essential hypertension groups. Ten patients in the primary aldosteronism group and 19 in the essential hypertension group reached the primary end point (P = .85). Cox analysis indicated that older age and longer duration of hypertension were factors independently associated with the cardiovascular end point. Cardiovascular outcome was comparable in patients with aldosteronism treated with adrenalectomy vs aldosterone antagonists (P = .71).
Conclusion  Primary aldosteronism is associated with a cardiovascular complication rate out of proportion to blood pressure levels that benefits substantially from surgical and medical treatment in the long term.
Primary aldosteronism is an endocrine disorder associated with hypertension, hypokalemia, and suppressed plasma renin levels in which inappropriate aldosterone secretion is caused by an adrenal adenoma or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. Recent evidence1,2 indicates a greater frequency of this disorder in hypertensive patients than the previously accepted prevalence of approximately 1%. Such increased prevalence may result from more effective identification of this disease.3 Because initial descriptions of patients with primary aldosteronism reported a low incidence of cardiovascular events,4 this form of hypertension has traditionally been considered relatively benign.5 More recent views, however, suggest that long-term exposure to elevated aldosterone levels might result in substantial cardiovascular damage independent of blood pressure.6
Animal studies demonstrate that exposure to excess levels of aldosterone, under appropriate dietary salt conditions, induces myocardial fibrosis,7 and evidence of aldosterone-related cardiac damage has been obtained from clinical trials8,9 conducted in patients with heart failure treated with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, with a significant decrease in the mortality rate. Although many surrogate cardiovascular end points6 as well as evidence of an increased rate of cardiovascular events10-13 have been reported in cross-sectional investigations conducted in patients with primary aldosteronism, longitudinal evidence is limited to 1 retrospective case-control study.14 The present study investigates long-term cardiovascular outcomes in patients with tumoral or idiopathic disease who were followed up after either adrenalectomy or treatment with spironolactone.
Methods
Study population
We conducted a prospective study in 54 consecutive patients who received a diagnosis of primary aldosteronism between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 2001. Recruitment of patients, criteria used for diagnosis, and methods of follow-up have been described in a previous publication.15 Patients were referred to the hypertension clinic of the University of Udine for evaluation of their hypertensive state. Blood pressure was measured using a mercury sphygmomanometer, and hypertension was diagnosed according to current guidelines. All patients seen at the clinic were screened with extensive testing to define the cause of hypertension.16 Antihypertensive drugs were discontinued a minimum of 2 weeks before diagnostic assessment.17 No patient was taking aldosterone antagonists before the study.
Primary aldosteronism was screened for by the demonstration of an increased plasma aldosterone to active renin ratio (â¥20)18 in the presence of a plasma aldosterone level greater than 150 pg/mL (15 ng/dL) (to convert to picomoles per liter, multiply by 27.74), and the diagnosis was confirmed by the lack of aldosterone suppression (values of â¥50 pg/mL [â¥5 ng/dL]) after an intravenous saline load (2 L of 0.9% saline infused during 4 hours).2 This test is highly effective in the distinction of primary aldosteronism from low-renin essential hypertension.19,20Measurements were performed in combination with a normal sodium diet, and 24-hour urinary sodium excretion was assessed in all the patients. Renal artery stenosis was excluded in all the patients by means of angiographic computed tomography (CT) and, in patients with measurable active renin concentrations (>2.5 pg/mL [to convert to picomoles per liter, multiply by 0.0237]), renal angiography.16 A plasma potassium concentration of 3.5 mEq/L or less (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1.0) was corrected by means of oral supplementation before assessment of the aldosterone to renin ratio and the saline suppression test.2 Differentiation between an adrenal adenoma and idiopathic aldosteronism was obtained using high-resolution CT followed by selective adrenal vein sampling (n = 14) or adrenal scintigraphy (n = 47) performed using iodocholesterol I 131 with dexamethasone suppression. In all the patients who underwent adrenalectomy, an adenoma was confirmed by histologic examination and by a significant decrease in aldosterone concentrations. Patients were treated with unilateral adrenalectomy or spironolactone (50-300 mg/d; mean, 121 mg/d), and in all the patients, treatment was followed by either normalization of or a significant reduction (a decrease >20% or use of fewer antihypertensive drugs) in blood pressure.
At baseline, patients with primary aldosteronism were compared with 323 patients with essential hypertension recruited by frequency matching after specification of the inclusion criteria to avoid age, sex, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and estimated duration of hypertension as potential confounders. In these patients, secondary causes of hypertension were excluded after drug washout.16,17 Informed consent was obtained from all patients, and the protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Udine.
Cardiovascular status was assessed in patients with primary aldosteronism and essential hypertension via a thorough medical record review and was confirmed at the end of the diagnostic workup. The workup included history, physical examination, electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography, and ultrasound examination of the abdominal aorta and the carotid, iliac, and femoral arteries. Additional assessments, including exercise stress testing, myocardial perfusion scanning, coronary arteriography, 24-hour ECG recording, and brain CT or magnetic resonance imaging, were performed when appropriate.16,21 All medical records were reviewed independently by 2 investigators (C.C. and L.A.S.) masked to the diagnosis of hypertension to assess previous occurrences of the following clinical events: myocardial infarction or reversible myocardial ischemia (angina pectoris or silent ischemia), stroke or transient ischemic attacks, sustained arrhythmias, and leg pain on exertion (claudication). All the retrospective diagnoses were confirmed by documentation of previous ECG changes, 24-hour ECG recording, significant elevation of the serum creatinine kinase MB fraction or troponin level, CT or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, vascular ultrasonography, or arteriography of the lower limbs.
Follow-up and cardiovascular outcomes
All 54 patients with primary aldosteronism and 108 patients with essential hypertension (obtained from the 323 individuals included in the baseline comparison) were prospectively followed up. After inclusion of each new patient with primary aldosteronism, 2 consecutive matched patients were selected for the longitudinal study. Twenty-four of 29 patients with adrenal adenomas underwent adrenalectomy; of the remaining 5 patients, 2 had bilateral adenomas and 3 refused surgery and were treated with spironolactone. Treatment with spironolactone was started at a dosage of 100 mg/d and was titrated to reach the target blood pressure. Clinical assessment and laboratory tests were performed 1, 3, and 6 months after enrollment and every 12 months thereafter. Dynamic 24-hour ECG recording was reassessed at 6 months and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 years to detect asymptomatic arrhythmic events and ST-segment changes. At each visit, antihypertensive drug therapy was adjusted according to the physician's judgment to achieve a blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg. Use of all antihypertensive agents was permitted. The cardiovascular status was reassessed at all periodic visits, with a mean follow-up of 7.4 years. A composite cardiovascular end point comprising myocardial infarction, stroke, any type of revascularization procedure, and sustained arrhythmias was designated as the primary outcome.
Statistical analysis
Continuous data are expressed as mean (SD) unless otherwise indicated. Variables with a skewed distribution were analyzed after logarithmic transformation. Characteristics of the study participants were compared among groups using analysis of covariance. Categorical variables were compared using the _2 test. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, we included the variables significantly associated with a history of cardiovascular events in univariate analysis. Data from the date of inclusion through the end of follow-up for all 54 patients with primary aldosteronism and 108 with essential hypertension were included in the analysis of cardiovascular outcomes. Actuarial analysis was applied to assess cardiovascular outcomes, and the log-rank test22 was used to compare the distributions of time with the cardiovascular end point. The Cox proportional hazards model23 was fitted to the data with all the significant risk factors to provide information on the hazard ratios (HRs). All tests for significance and resulting P values were 2-sided, with a level of significance of P < .05.
Results
Baseline clinical characteristics of the study patients
Adrenal adenomas were demonstrated in 29 of 54 patients (54%) with primary aldosteronism, whereas the remaining 25 patients (46%) had idiopathic aldosteronism. Patients with primary aldosteronism and essential hypertension (n = 323) had comparable blood pressure,estimated duration of hypertension, plasma glucose levels, plasma lipid levels, smoking frequency, and alcohol intake (Table 1). As expected, patients with primary aldosteronism had higher plasma aldosterone levels and lower plasma potassium and renin levels than patients with essential hypertension.
A history of cardiovascular events was reported in 34 patients (11%) with essential hypertension and in 19 (35%) with primary aldosteronism (odds ratio, 4.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.38-8.95; P < .001), with a significantly higher prevalence of coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular events, and sustained arrhythmias in patients with primary aldosteronism than in those with essential hypertension (Table 2). In patients with primary aldosteronism, those with or without detectable adrenal adenomas had a comparable prevalence of cardiovascular events. Multivariate analysis indicated that the variables independently associated with a history of cardiovascular events were age (P < .001), duration of hypertension (P < .001), mean blood pressure (P = .008), current smoking status (P = .01), and diagnosis of primary aldosteronism (P = .01).
Treatment and follow-up
Twenty-four patients with primary aldosteronism underwent adrenalectomy, and 30 (5 with adrenal adenomas and 25 with idiopathic aldosteronism) were treated with a spironolactone-based regimen. The mean duration of follow-up was 7.4 years. No patient discontinued the study, and adherence at the yearly visits was 93% in the primary aldosteronism group and 89% in the essential hypertension group. Of 21 men treated with spironolactone, 4 (19%) had clinically relevant gynecomastia that responded well to a reduction in dosage. In the primary aldosteronism and essential hypertension groups, the blood pressure declined significantly in the first 6 months of the study and remained stable thereafter, with mean values of 136/81 mm Hg and 137/81 mm Hg, respectively. In the first year, plasma potassium concentrations in patients with primary aldosteronism increased significantly from baseline levels (from 3.2 [0.4] to 4.1 [0.3] mEq/L; P < .001).
During follow-up no patient died. Ten of 54 patients in the primary aldosteronism group and 19 of 108 patients in the essential hypertension group reached the primary end point (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.42-2.02; P = .85) (Figure). Myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization procedures, and sustained arrhythmias occurred in 1 (2%), 2 (4%), 3 (6%), and 4 (7%) of the patients with primary aldosteronism and in 2 (2%), 3 (3%), 5 (5%), and 9 (8%) of the patients with essential hypertension, respectively (all nonsignificant). On univariate analysis, the factors associated with occurrence of the primary end point in the primary aldosteronism and essential hypertension groups were age (27% of patients aged >52 years and 9% of patients aged â¤52 years; P = .002), estimated duration of hypertension (26% of patients with a duration >10 years and 10% of patients with a duration â¤10 years; P = .008), and persistent smoking (39% of smokers and 14% of nonsmokers; P = .004), whereas no significant associations were found with sex, body mass index, plasma lipid levels, diagnosis of primary aldosteronism, or specific drug types taken during follow-up. Potentially relevant factors were included in a multivariate model to predict determinants of outcome. Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that younger age (as a continuous variable, P = .01) and shorter duration of hypertension (as a continuous variable, P = .02) were associated with a better cardiovascular outcome. A proportional hazards model was fitted with the significant risk factors as categorical variables showing that age older than 52 years (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.17-2.28; P = .01) and a history of hypertension lasting more than 10 years (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.15; P = .03) were significant adverse factors. Actuarial analysis of patients treated with adrenalectomy vs aldosterone antagonists did not reveal significant differences in the occurrence of the combined cardiovascular end point (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.36-4.44; P = .71) (Figure).
Comment
This study examined the prevalence of cardiovascular events in patients with tumoral and idiopathic aldosteronism and the long-term incidence of cardiovascular outcomes after treatment. The results demonstrate that cardiovascular complications are more prevalent in patients with primary aldosteronism than in patients with essential hypertension and comparable cardiovascular risk profiles. This difference in the rate of cardiovascular events is reversed by removing the effects of excess aldosterone with either adrenalectomy or treatment with aldosterone antagonists.
Primary aldosteronism is a simple clinical model to assess possible detrimental effects of elevated aldosterone levels on the cardiovascular system because, in this condition, its effects are isolated from those of the renin-angiotensin axis. Although left ventricular hypertrophy,24,25impaired diastolic function,26 abnormalities of blood vessels,27 and endothelial dysfunction28have been reported in patients with this endocrine disorder, clinical evidence supporting an association between primary aldosteronism and cardiovascular events is limited to cross-sectional studies that have yielded variable results.4,5,10-13,29 In the only longitudinal, retrospective study, Milliez et al14 examined a large cohort of patients with adrenal adenomas or idiopathic aldosteronism, reporting an excess rate of cardiovascular events compared with patients with essential hypertension.
The present study was conducted in consecutive patients with primary aldosteronism diagnosed using standardized functional tests and imaging procedures that were homogeneously applied by the same physicians.15 This practice, together with the collection of data in a single database, should have limited any possible selection bias. Moreover, patients with primary aldosteronism were compared with patients with essential hypertension matched for age, sex, severity, and estimated duration of hypertension and had comparable cardiovascular risk profiles. The baseline comparison demonstrated a greater prevalence of cardiovascular disease in primary aldosteronism than in essential hypertension, with odds ratios of 4.93, 4.36, and 2.80 for sustained arrhythmias, cerebrovascular events, and coronary heart disease, respectively. Also, the prevalence of cardiovascular complications was comparable in patients with tumoral or idiopathic disease, showing that those with both subtypes are at increased risk. These findings support the contention that elevated aldosterone levels contribute to cardiovascular damage independent of blood pressure.
To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to examine the long-term cardiovascular outcomes of patients with primary aldosteronism after treatment. Our long-term follow-up establishes that in this condition, the incidence of cardiovascular events does not differ from that of essential hypertension when the effects of excess aldosterone are permanently removed. Stepwise logistic regression and multivariate Cox analyses indicate that younger age and shorter duration of hypertension are independent predictors of better cardiovascular outcome, underscoring the importance of a timely correction of this disorder. Furthermore, the Kaplan-Meier curves did not differ in patients with primary aldosteronism treated with adrenalectomy or spironolactone, showing that these treatments have comparable effects in this context.
The findings of the present study are in keeping with the results of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study8 and the Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study.9 These trials were prompted by the experimental demonstration of aldosterone-induced myocardial fibrosis30-32 and clinical evidence of abnormal myocardial texture33and diastolic dysfunction26 in patients with primary aldosteronism. Consistently, mineralocorticoid receptor blockade has been shown to improve variables of diastolic function in hypertensive patients with diastolic heart failure.34 Therefore, it seems reasonable to suggest that elevated aldosterone levels induce cardiac fibrosis that, in turn, could explain the increased rates of sustained arrhythmias and possible myocardial ischemia. On the other hand, clinical studies indicate that excess aldosterone concentrations increase arterial stiffness35 and induce endothelial dysfunction,28 effects that might be related to the increased rate of coronary and cerebrovascular disease.
A limitation of this study could be the use of a variety of antihypertensive medications during follow-up, which might have affected the cardiovascular outcomes. A greater percentage of patients with essential hypertension received these drugs compared with patients with primary aldosteronism. This difference, however, should have determined better outcomes in the essential hypertension group, but this was not the case. Moreover, separate analysis of patients who were and were not taking specific types of drugs did not show a different rate of cardiovascular events.
The prevention of cardiovascular complications is a mandatory goal in patients with high blood pressure. Primary aldosteronism was once considered a rare disease, but recent evidence suggests that it might be the most common curable cause of hypertension. Therefore, despite a consensus not being reached yet, it might be worth considering broad screening by use of the aldosterone to renin ratio in every patient with high blood pressure. This study demonstrates that primary aldosteronism is associated with a prevalence of cardiovascular complications out of proportion to blood pressure that benefits substantially from treatment in the long term. In this view, adrenalectomy and aldosterone antagonists seem to be of considerable therapeutic value to the extent that, with adequate blood pressure control, they limit the progression of cardiovascular disease. These findings underline the importance of appropriate timing in the identification of this endocrine disorder to effectively prevent cardiovascular complications."

Abstract
Background
Hypertension with hyperaldosteronism could be associated with stroke attributable to endothelial injury. Whether the detrimental effect of aldosterone on stroke among primary aldosteronism patients could be mitigated by administration of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist or by reduction of aldosterone level via adrenalectomy is still inconclusive.
Methods
Primary aldosteronism and essential hypertensive patients were enrolled in the Taiwan National Health Insurance from 1997 to 2009. We used a validated algorithm to enroll primary aldosteronism patients. We conducted a competing risk analysis, using a time-varying Cox proportional hazard model.
Results
We enrolled 3,167 primary aldosteronism patients with a subgroup of 1,047 aldosterone-producing adenoma patients, and matched these with essential hypertensive controls in a 1:4 ratio. The risk of incident stroke, both ischemic and hemorrhagic, was statistically higher in primary aldosteronism patients than in their essential hypertensive control. The differences in stroke incidences between primary aldosteronism and essential hypertensive patients significantly increased as the hypertensive period lengthened. Primary aldosteronism patients who received mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist treatment had higher risk of all stroke (competing hazard ratio = 1.83, P < .001) compared with their essential hypertensive controls. In light of this, aldosterone-producing adenoma patients had a lower risk of incident stroke after adrenalectomy (competing for hazard ratio = 0.75), but a higher cumulative risk of incident stroke after mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist only (competing for hazard ratio = 1.76) than their matched essential hypertensive patients.
Conclusion
We observed an increased stroke risk among primary aldosteronism patients than among their matched essential hypertensive controls. A prolonged duration of hypertension was proportionate to the raised risk of stroke. Our findings emphasize the importance of aldosterone-producing adenoma benefitting from adrenalectomy in attenuating the cerebrovascular event.
Introduction
Hypertension is an independent risk factor for strokes, leading to an estimated 2- to 4-fold increase in the number of strokes when compared with that in normotensive patients.1 Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Evidence of increased stroke risk is increasing among all PA patients.2,3Stroke incidence was significantly higher in patients with PA than in patients with essential hypertension (EH).3, 4, 5 Hypertension causes blood-brain barrier breakdown by triggering the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which will increase endothelial injury.
Similarly, patients with raised plasma aldosterone appear to have a blood pressure-independent increased risk of stroke.6 Long-term hyperaldosteronism contributes to endothelial damage, leading to premature coronary artery disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, and proteinuria, all of which increase the propensity for stroke. Among patients with either regular or high sodium intake, an excessive aldosterone concentration causes oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in the cerebral circulation7 and has been identified as a predictor of stroke or transient ischemic attacks.8 Also, animal models have shown that aldosterone has a pernicious impact on cerebrovascular comorbidity, independent of that of blood pressure and hypokalemia.9
Thus, we focused on the incidence of strokes from PA/aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) patients who underwent adrenalectomy or were administered mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) treatment in this propensity scoreâmatched case-control study. We employed the Taiwan National Health Insurance (TNHI) research data set, a national population-based health care insurance reimbursement system, which empowers accurate diagnosis recording and scrutinizes the medications and procedures administered, to analyze the nationwide health care outcome for PA.
Materials and Methods
Study population
The TNHI database is a nationwide population-based health care insurance reimbursement program including more than 99% of the population in Taiwan (23.12 million in 2009).10 The Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database contains registration information and data for original claims for reimbursement.
We established a hypertension cohort, including either EH or PA patients from all beneficiaries enrolled in the TNHI, by extracting original data from 1997 to 2009. All data for a given individual are linked by a unique national identification number associated with every record for that individual in the database. To ensure confidentiality, identification numbers were encrypted before being released for research, but the uniqueness of the encrypted identification is retained to ensure strong internal linkage.
Patient identification
We used the validated algorithm to detect patients with PA, recruiting only patients age â¥18 y of age (9th International Classification of Diseases [ICD-9] code: 255.1)11 (Fig 1).
Fig 1. Flow diagram of selecting study subjects. APA, aldosterone-producing adenoma; EH, essential hypertension; MRA, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, PA, primary aldosteronism.
We enrolled patients with MRA use (belonging to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system, class C03D) with the PA ICD-9 coding to assure both high sensitivity and positive predictive value of PA patient inclusion.11 PA patients were matched with EH controls (1:4 ratio) by propensity score (Table I). The categories of antihypertensivemedications were not matched because the PA patients did not use any MRA during the screening period.
Table I. Comparison of characteristics between PA and EH patients_
APA patients were identified for possible treatment with either unilateral adrenalectomyor MRA. APA patients have been noted to experience cardiovascular events (eg, coronary events, strokes, and arrhythmias) more frequently than patients with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH).2 For comparisons between patients with APA treated with surgery versus. MRA, PA patients with a diagnosis of adrenal tumor (ICD code: 227, 227.0, 239.7) were further analyzed as APA patients.11, 12, 13
Baseline characteristics
For each group, we collected baseline characteristics of each patient, concomitant medication associated with blood pressure, and outcome. The TNHI claims that data regarding adrenalectomy and medications are reliable because they were reimbursed for TNHI procedures and drug codes that were tied to the TNHI reimbursement system with auditing. The indications and guidelines for hypertensive management in Taiwan have been proposed and revised by the Taiwan Society of Hypertension.14 In essence, a diagnostic algorithm was proposed, emphasizing the European Society of Cardiology and European Society of Hypertension joint hypertension guideline to loosen blood pressure targets to <140/90 mmHg for all patients14 and the antihypertension agents were reimbursed by the TNHI system post audit.
Outcomes of interest
Incident stroke was defined by any 1 of the following conditions in those who had no history of stroke at baseline15:
â¢	1.
Records of emergency room service or hospitalization claim for >1 day or records of emergency room service with ICD-9-CM codes of 430 to 438 followed by claims for various brain-imaging technologies (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or transcranial or carotid Doppler sonography) or claims for rehabilitation and anticoagulation prescriptions customarily used for ischemic stroke.
â¢	2.
Records of >3 consecutive outpatient visits with ICD-9-CM codes of 430 to 438 and claims for examinations, services, or prescriptions as described in condition 1.16
The ICD-9 codes for strokes (from the Taiwan National Health Research Institutes) in hospital discharge had a high accuracy in the substantial kappa test.11,17,18 Patients were enrolled from 1997 to 2009. Therefore, there was a minimum of a 1-year latency to ascertain the absence of stroke after patient enrollment.
On-target treatments
We stratified PA or APA patients into groups of those who underwent adrenalectomy and those who received MRA treatment. Among PA patients who underwent adrenalectomy, adrenal tumors were recorded in 96% of them.12,19
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as mean Â± standard deviation (SD), and categorical variables were expressed as percentages. PA/APA patients were matched to their EH patients with the method of estimated propensity score, using a greedy matching algorithm with a caliper width of 0.2 SD of the log of the odds of the estimated propensity score. The sampling ratio between patients of PA to EH and APA to EH was 1:4. Statistical significance was defined as a 2-sided P < .05. We also took into account the propensity score for the PA diagnosis to minimize residual confounding effects in the matching process. In these models, additional adjustments included the control for the direct effects of age, sex, concomitant medications, and comorbidities (Table II). We also adopted competing risk regression with the subdistribution hazard. Because of the high mortality and stroke rates in male patients of advanced age, competing risk regression was also performed by using the Fine and Gray model, considering the subdistribution hazard. Because adrenalectomy and MRA prescription are the main treatments after a PA diagnosis, we used a Cox proportional hazards model with time-varying covariates to account for their influences on the risk of outcomes. We simulated and depicted 10-year survival curves of the probability of incident stroke under various scenarios of treatment with MRA and adrenalectomy among all PA patients. We also drew a conditional effect plot for outcome prediction based on the fitted final logistic regression model (Fig 2) The model estimated the probability of having a stroke against the hypertensive period, with the values of the other discrete and continuous covariates held constant.18,20 We used a multilevel discrete-time event history analysis and adopted a generalized additive model (GAM), with adjustment for risk factors presented in Table I (Fig 3), to evaluate the threshold dosage of spironolactone. The model incorporates the subject-specific (longitudinal) random effects, expressed as the logarithm of the odds (logit). The amount of spironolactone was converted to the number of defined daily doses (DDDs) as defined by the World Health Organization. The DDD of MRA time span was calculated from 30 days to 365 days before mortality or the end of the study (Fig 3). The probability of outcome events was constructed with spironolactone level and was centered on having an average of 0 over the range of the data as constructed with the GAM.
Table II. Incidence and risks for outcome of interest between PA patients and their EH matches_
We used R software, v 2.8.1 (Free Software Foundation, Inc, Boston, MA) for the time-varying Cox model and we used Stata/MP v 12 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX) for competing risk analysis. The 2-sided P-value < .05 was considered statistically significant. Because patients were anonymous in our study, no informed consent was required.
Results
Characteristics of the study population
We enrolled 3,167 adult patients with PA and identified a subgroup of 1,047 patients with APA in this study. Table II summarizes the demographic and clinical characteristics of these patients, as well as those of their matched EH controls. The mean age of the PA group was 50.8 years at the time of PA diagnosis. The mean age of the APA subgroup was 47.4 years. The results of statistical analysis presented in Table II indicate that our study performed well in constructing the 2 case-control matches for the entire PA group and the APA subgroup.
Long-term risks of stroke and death among PA versus matched EH patients
Incidence of all strokes was higher in the PA group than in EH controls (15.1% vs 9.9%, P < .001). Both incidences of ischemic (13.1% vs 8.6%, P < .001) and hemorrhagic strokes (4.4% vs 2.1%, P < .001) were higher in the PA group than in the EH controls. PA patients were more likely to use antihypertensive drugs than their EH controls. PA patients had a similar mortality risk (11.84% vs. 12.23%, P = .564) but a higher composite outcome risk (15.95% vs. 13.55%, P = .001) regarding mortality or stroke than EH patients, even after targeted treatments.
To further explore the association of the length of the hypertensive period with the incidence of all strokes, we constructed a statistical correlation curve based on the results. Figure 2 illustrates a conditional effect plot of the estimated risk of long-term stroke, stratified by PA status, against the hypertensive period. The results exhibited that, in the long term, PA patients had a significantly higher incidence of strokes than EH patients. Also, the differences in stroke incidence between PA and EH patients significantly increased as the hypertensive period lengthened (P < .001). Consistent with the results for PA patients, APA patients presented a trend for risk of stroke (10.7% vs. 8.7%, P = .066) although it was not statistically significant. After targeted treatments, APA patients had both a lower risk of mortality (4.20% vs 10.46%, P < .001) and composite outcome (6.02% vs 11.65%, P < .001) than their EH matches.
All stroke-incidence rate was higher in the PA samples (32.1 per 1,000 person-years) than in EH controls (20.8 per 1,000 person-years), and the incidence of stroke was also higher in APA patients (19.1 per 1000 person-years) than in their EH controls (16.5 per 1,000 person-years; Table III).

Comparison of risks of stroke and death between PA/APA patients taking medication or undergoing surgical treatment
To comprehensively analyze the difference in PA/APA-associated risk of stroke, our study compared the risks of stroke and death between PA patients who underwent targeted treatments and their EH controls, for the entire PA group and the APA subgroup. PA patients who underwent adrenalectomy had an attenuated risk of all strokes (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.53, P < .001) compared with their EH controls after adjusting for mortality as a competing risk; however, PA patients with MRA treatment had a higher risk of all strokes (HR = 1.83, P < 0.001) than their EH controls (Fig 4, A).

(B) Cumulative proportions to ischemic stroke curve of the PA group with target managements (MRA treatment or adrenalectomy) and their EH controls, taking mortality as a competing risk (MRA versus EH, adrenalectomy versus EH, all P < .001).

EH, essential hypertension; MRA, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist; PA, primary aldosteronism.
In subgroup analyses, PA patients who underwent adrenalectomy had a decreased risks of ischemic (HR = 0.61, P = .002) and similar hemorrhagic stroke (HR = 0.65, P = .180) compared with their matched EH controls; however, the PA group with MRA treatment had a higher risk of ischemic (HR = 1.78, P < .001) and hemorrhagic stroke (HR = 2.38, P < .001) after adjusting for mortality as a competing risk factor (Fig 4, B and C).
In addition, PA patients who underwent adrenalectomy had a lower adjusted HR (HR = 0.36, P < .001) of mortality than their EH controls, but PA patients with MRA treatment did not differ from their respective controls (HR = 1.10, P = .124).
APA patients who underwent adrenalectomy had decreased risk (HR = 0.75, P = .049) of stroke relative to their EH matches after adjusting for mortality as a competing risk; however, APA patients with MRA treatment had an increased risk of stroke relative to EH patients (HR = 1.76, P < .001). We also noted that APA patients who underwent adrenalectomy had a similar risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke (HR = 0.85, P = 0.310 and HR = 0.97, P = 0.920, separately) to their controls, and APA patients with MRA treatment had a higher risk of ischemic stroke (HR = 1.75, P < .001) and hemorrhagic stroke (HR = 1.21, P = .530). Both APA with adrenalectomy and MRA treatment had a lower adjusted HR of mortality (adjusted HR = 0.37, P < .001, HR = 0.48, P = .001) and composite outcome (adjusted HR = 0.50, P < .001, adjusted HR = 0.57, P = .003) compared with their controls.

Subgroup analysis exhibited consistency in the ameliorating effect of adrenalectomy on incident stroke among various subgroups of PA patients with variable confounding diseases (Fig 5, A). MRA treatment of PA could not improve or augment the risk of all stroke compared with EH controls (Fig 5, B).

Consistent with earlier results, APA patients who underwent adrenalectomy had an all stroke risk similar to their EH controls (Fig 5, C). All stroke risk was neither improved nor augmented in APA patient treatment with MRA compared with their EH controls (Fig 5, D).
Comparison of the effect of adrenalectomy on the long-term risk of incident stroke under a framework of subgroup analysis
To investigate the consistency in the beneficial effect of adrenalectomy among various groups in PA patients, we further conducted subgroup analysis to baseline comorbidity that further adjusted for age and sex. We found that adrenalectomy was consistently associated with a much lower long-term risk of death across broad varieties of patient groups, especially in APA patients who received adrenalectomy (Fig 6). BAH patients who received MRA had the highest incidence of stroke. APA patients who underwent adrenalectomy had a decreased risk of stroke, but APA patients with MRA treatment had a similar risk of stroke relative to BAH patients.

Discussion
We observed an increased risk of stroke among PA patients relative to their matched EH controls. Moreover, prolonged duration of hypertension was associated with increased risk of stroke (Figs 2 and 4, AâC). Also, PA patients had a higher incidence of composite outcome regarding death and stroke. We found a significant difference of incident strokes observed among surgically treated and MRA-treated APA patients compared with EH controls, and adrenalectomy could decrease the risk of stroke (Fig 6).
The high incidence of stroke has been attributed, at least in part, to the direct effect of aldosterone on the vessel wall, inducing inflammation, fibrosis, and remodeling.21Further plausible mechanisms are aldosterone-related vascular stiffness, nephrosclerosis, and intractable hypertension, which are attributed to fragile vasculopathy as well as arterial stiffness.22 The increased rate of atrial arrhythmias in PA patients23 could be further attributed to the high incidence of stroke. Furthermore, the number and function of circulating endothelial progenitor cells were suppressed by aldosterone and could interfere with vascular endothelial integrity.19
Outcomes of PA/APA after targeted treatment
PA patients had an increased stroke risk after MRA treatment, implicating the importance of early diagnosis of APA patients and advising adrenalectomy among patients with an acceptable surgical risk. Adrenalectomy not only corrects the high blood pressure and biochemical parameters but also reverses the adverse vascular change in APA patients. Such a hypothesis is also supported by the following observation that, in a recent study, PA patients who underwent adrenalectomy were at reduced risk of mortality and lowered blood pressure compared with their matched EH controls.13
The 11_-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type II metabolizes cortisol to cortisone (11-dehydroxycorticosterone) in mice, preventing it from binding to and activating mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs). However, aldosterone affects _-cell function and ultimately to apoptosis24 and cardiac fibrosis25 via glucocorticoid receptor but not MR.
Most important, the signaling milieu is likely very different after ischemia than in the healthy brain, and several studies show that MR activation is required for neuronal survival, both in vivo and in the cell culture system.26 However, MR blockade 1 hour before the induction of ischemia resulted in increased cell death.27 In the present study, the long-term use of MR blockade did not appear to be neuroprotective.
On the other hand, Arlt et al.28 have demonstrated the possibility that glucocorticoid cosecretion exists in patients with PA and will at a minimum partially contribute to associated adverse metabolic risks, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and osteoporosis.12,29,30 The studies we have been discussing further explain the additional clinical benefits of adrenalectomy when compared with MRA treatment.
In our subgroup analysis of 10-year risk scenarios (Fig 6), the stroke rate will further increase in medical treatment compared with EH. APA patients who did not receive adrenalectomy have a higher incidence of mortality. Similarly, a study exhibited that the incidence of cardiovascular events during the follow-up period was higher in BAH patients than in EH controls, although there were no differences in BP levels.2 This observation suggests that aldosterone plays a detrimental role, independent of its effect on blood pressure. Our study also reveals the importance of dose-response analysis regarding MRA use and incident stroke. Here, further concerns about MRA prescription, such as medication compliance with inadequate dose (Fig 3), most likely due in part to frequent occurrences of dose-dependent side effects, especially gynecomastia or dysmenorrhea, and a subsequent decrease in efficacy.31 These phenomena suggest that the usual doses of MRA in clinical practice might be too lowâa problem calling for more attention. Therefore, impaired neuroprotection attributed to long-term aldosterone autonomous hypersecretion could not be attenuated by MRA treatment.
Consistent with earlier findings,32 our study found that a longer hypertensive duration was associated with a higher risk of stroke, both hemorrhagic and ischemic. Early diagnosis of PA is recommended because patients presenting with PA are reported to have a higher frequency of cardiovascular events4,23 and stroke than patients with EH. Adrenalectomy as an early targeted treatment is the most effective means of reversing arterial stiffness.33
This cohort has several unmeasured confounders, such as body mass index, smoking status, blood pressure, and potassium and aldosterone levels. Moreover, we could not identify PA patients with bilateral adenomas or unilateral hyperplasia, and the difference between them was ambiguous. However, the incidence of the two subgroups is relatively low, and our results were robust across the various models, strengthening our conclusion. Likewise, not all EH patients were screened from secondary hypertension. Despite such possible impurity of the EH control group, the patients in the PA group according to our inclusion criteria still had a higher incidence of stroke than the EH controls, and this result is what we want to underscore.
We emphasize that it is essential to recognize the high incidence of stroke, both ischemic and hemorrhagic, among PA patients and that early proactive screening should be performed in at-risk patients. Our findings further emphasize the importance of early identification of APA and appropriate surgical treatment; however, we also identified that the risk of incident stroke could not decrease after MRA treatment, which calls for more efforts to formulate a better treatment strategy for those patients in whom adrenalectomy is not feasible. Nevertheless, it will be necessary to perform a prospective controlled study to confirm our results further."

Patients and Methods We used a longitudinal population database from the Taiwan National Health Insurance system and applied a validated algorithm to identify patients with PA diagnosed between 1997 and 2009. Results There were 2699 patients with PA recruited, of whom 761 patients with an aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) were identified. The incidence rate of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) was 3% in patients with PA after targeted treatments and 5.2 years of follow-up, which was comparable to the rate in controls with essential hypertension (EH). However, after taking mortality as a competing risk, we found a significantly lower incidence of ESRD when comparing patients with PA vs EH [subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR), 0.38; P = 0.007] and patients with APA vs EH (sHR 0.55; P = 0.021) after adrenalectomy; however, we did not see similar results in groups with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA)\xe2\x80\x92treated PA vs EH. There was also a significantly lower incidence of mortality in groups with PA and APA who underwent adrenalectomy than among EH controls (P < 0.001). Conclusion Regarding incident ESRD, patients with PA were comparable to their EH counterparts after treatment. After adrenalectomy, patients with APA had better long-term outcomes regarding progression to ESRD and mortality than hypertensive controls, but MRA treatments did not significantly affect outcome. Primary aldosteronism (PA; i.e., autonomous aldosterone hypersecretion) is noted in 3.9% of patients with stage 1 hypertension, and the proportion increases to 11.8% in patients with stage 3 hypertension. However, a number of cardiovascular and renal sequelae of PA cannot be entirely attributed to the effects of hypertension alone. The reported risk of cardiovascular events was higher in patients with PA, with proinflammatory mediators and oxidative stress affecting multiple organs, than in otherwise similar patients with essential hypertension (EH). Prolonged aldosterone excess also causes relative kidney hyperfiltration and reversible intrarenal vascular structural changes, which disguise consequent renal injury, including declining glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and proteinuria. Aldosterone has been reported to induce direct glomerular injury and proteinuria independently of its hemodynamic effects, such as a high estimated GFR and albuminuria. Hence, PA is associated with higher rates of renal blood flow and, in a previous study, characterized by partially reversible renal dysfunction in which a dynamic, rather than structural, renal defect was demonstrated in a previous study. Although a long-term follow-up study with limited PA patients showed similar therapeutic effects on kidney function, adrenalectomy and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) treatments have different short-term clinical impacts with respect to kidney damage, even with a similar blood pressure\xe2\x80\x92lowering effect. In fact, an initial temporary worsening of renal function within 1 month of adrenalectomy has been reported, and the decline in renal function could be the result of correction of glomerular hyperfiltration via decreased aldosterone excess\xe2\x80\x92related intrarenal vascular resistance or systemic hemodynamic change. A systemic review supported surgical resection of PA, which can be performed with low morbidity. Adrenalectomy is safe, reverses aldosterone excess, and is effective at normalizing blood pressure and decreasing medication requirements, particularly in younger adults; however, regarding kidney function, the long-term benefit/risk ratio of adrenalectomy compared with MRA treatment is lacking, and additional studies are warranted. The Taiwan National Health Insurance research database contains records of claims that comprehensively capture information on episodes of care across all hospitals and nearly all health care facilities across Taiwan. Taking advantage of the merits of this database, we examined long-term crucial outcomes of renal events, namely end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and mortality among patients with PA receiving targeted treatment. We scrutinized the effects of different treatment options for PA on ESRD and mortality and subsequently explored the benefits of treatment strategies for reducing long-term ESRD and mortality risk among patients with PA. 1. Materials and Methods A. Patient Enrollment This study extracted National Health Insurance (NHI) reimbursement data from 1997 to 2009. The Taiwan government launched the NHI program in 1995. The NHI covers outpatient visits, hospital admissions, prescriptions, and intervention procedures and maintains disease profiles for >99% of the Taiwanese population. The NHI improved access to health care and reduced economic disparity in health care use in the late 1990s. As shown by financial reports from the National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA), the electronic database of NHI claims contains comprehensive information on disease diagnosis and health care use, particularly for cases requiring expensive services. The NHI database has provided research data for various studies on epidemiology, health services research, and clinical medicine. To detect fraud in the NHI, the NHIA routinely audits data submitted by health care institutions. The NHIA has been the only provider to the NHI, and to avoid NHIA rejection of reimbursement claims, physicians in Taiwan usually follow clinical guidelines. Because the gold standard for diagnosis of PA is still AVS which is costly and invasive, Taiwanese physicians follow the clinical practice guidelines of the Society of Aldosteronism\xe2\x80\x94the Taiwan PA consensus \xe2\x80\x94and focus on performing lateralization tests on patients with a high possibility of PA after a confirmation test. B. Algorithms for Identifying PA We used a validated algorithm to detect patients with PA, recruiting only patients aged \xe2\x89\xa518 years [International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code: 255.1]. We also found an algorithm with a positive predictive value of 0.9 to ensure the reliability of the sample identified by the algorithm to portray clinical outcomes in patients with PA. We enrolled only patients with PA who had used MRA [belonging to anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) class C03D] because our main study aim was to construct a reliable PA sample according to our validation. For comparisons between patients with an aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) treated with surgery vs MRA, patients with PA and the diagnosis of adrenal tumor (ICD-9 code: 227, 227.0, 239.7) were further classified as having APA. Among patients with PA who underwent adrenalectomy, an adrenal tumor was recorded in 96%. In addition, because patient adherence in taking medication plays a crucial role in successful medical treatment and can affect mortality, we calculated each patient\xe2\x80\x99s medication possession ratio for MRA (belonging to ATC class C03D). Adherence was calculated across all disease-modifying drugs for a 12-month postindex date. We developed additional algorithms to ascertain comorbid conditions among patients with PA. Except for a couple of morbid conditions requiring more detailed International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification coding for confirmation, we used only the first three digits of these codes to identify morbid conditions, rather than more digits. This rule also tended to yield a lower rate of type II error in identifying comorbidities. During review of the NHI data, the identification of a specific morbid condition was based on the criterion of at least one inpatient NHI record or three outpatient records with the corresponding disease diagnosis within 1 year before the time of first PA diagnosis; this method has been well validated. In this nested propensity, score-matched, case-control study, patients with EH were ascertained from those with the diagnosis of hypertension and received antihypertensive agents (from ATC) after we excluded patients with secondary hypertension. The duration of hypertension was defined as the period from the first prescription of antihypertension agents to the index date. C. Outcomes The outcomes of this study were long-term all-cause mortality and ESRD. We used a subsequent selective period of 90 days to define ESRD because all patients receiving dialysis for more than 90 days in Taiwan can apply for dialysis-related catastrophic cards in the NHI program. Patients with catastrophic illness certification who get care for the illness or related conditions within the certificate\'s validity period do not need to provide a copayment for outpatient or inpatient care. D. Statistical Analyses Student t tests and \xcf\x872 tests were used to assess differences between the patients with PA and those with identified EH. We matched patients with PA/APA to patients with EH using a greedy matching algorithm with a caliper width of 0.2 SDs of the log odds of the estimated propensity score. The sampling ratio for patients with PA/patients with EH and for patients with APA/patients with EH was 1:4. In various subsequent multivariable models for analyzing outcomes, we took into account the propensity score for the PA diagnosis to minimize residual confounding effects in the matching process. To estimate each patient\xe2\x80\x99s propensity score for PA diagnosis, we fit a separate multivariable logistic regression model with factors predicting PA. The caliper distance was 0.25. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models before and after propensity score matching were applied to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of study outcomes. The significance level for entry and the significance level for stay were set to 0.15 for conservative purposes. Then, with the aid of substantive knowledge, the best-candidate final Cox model was identified by manually dropping the covariates with P value >0.05 one at a time until all regression coefficients were significantly different from 0. Cox regression models with time-varying covariates accounted for their influence on risk of ESRD or death. Time-varying covariates took the value 0 before the start of MRA or surgical treatment and could switch to 1 at the start of treatment. Additional adjustments in these models included control for direct effects from age, sex, concomitant medications, and the comorbidities listed in Table 1 (and in an online repository). Regarding factors associated with outcomes in further parametric modeling, we adopted three modeling methods: simple Cox regression, multivariable Cox regression, and competing risk regression. We took mortality as competing risk due to the high mortality rate among elderly patients with ESRD, competing-risk regression using the Fine and Gray model with consideration of the subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) was also performed to show the risk of progression to ESRD..

On the basis of this hazard function, we further simulated and depicted 10-year survival curves for the probability of incident ESRD under different scenarios of treatment with MRA and adrenalectomy among all patients with PA. Specifically, we stratified patients by PA subgroup status including age, sex, urbanization level, monthly income and the comorbidities after targeted treatment and used the mean values of all other covariates for our study patients. We used R software, version 2.8.1 (Free Software Foundation, Inc., Boston, MA); competing risk analysis was performed with Stata/MP version 12 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX). A two-sided P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. 2. Results The process of selecting patients for the newly identified PA and matched EH groups is listed in Fig. 1. Among 4796 patients with an initial diagnosis of PA from the NHRI 1997 to 2009 database, 1571 patients were excluded. As shown, 2699 adults had confirmed PA according to the algorithm; among them, 657 adults underwent adrenalectomy and 2042 patients were administered MRA (Fig. 1). Flowchart of the participants in the cohort (PA/APA cohort and essential hypertension cohort). *Patients who did not use MRA during the year before or 2 year after the first PA coding. **Secondary hypertension excluded. A. Comparing Adults With EH and Adults With PA After propensity score matching during index clinical visits, 10,796 patients with EH were identified. The mean age of patients at the time of PA diagnosis was 51.6 years, and the proportion of men was 45.6% (Table 1). Likewise, 761 patients with APA (mean age, 48.0 years, 43.2% male) were matched with 3044 EH controls . B. Comparing the Risk of ESRD Between Patients With PA/APA and Their EH Matches The incidence rate of ESRD in the EH control group was 5.8 events/1000 person-years, and the PA group had an incidence rate of 5.5 events/1000 person-years after targeted treatment; the APA group had an incidence rate of 2.3 events/1000 person-years (average, 5.2 \xc2\xb1 3.5 years of follow-up) (Table 2). The competing sHR for developing incident ESRD after targeted treatment was 0.96 (P = 0.730) among the PA cohort, and 0.50 (P = 0.031) among the APA cohort relative to their EH cohort after accounting for mortality in the competing effects.

C. Comparing the Risk of ESRD and Mortality Between Patients With PA/APA and Their EH Matches  Table 3 shows that the risks of mortality (adjusted HR, 0.22; P < 0.001), ESRD (sHR, 0.38; P = 0.007), and ESRD with mortality (adjusted HR, 0.26; P < 0.001) among patients with PA who underwent adrenalectomy were all significantly decreased compared with those of EH controls. In an additional analysis, patients with APA who underwent adrenalectomy had decreased incidences of ESRD (sHR, 0.55; P = 0.021), mortality (adjusted HR, 0.31; P < 0.001), and ESRD with mortality (adjusted HR, 0.35; P < 0.001) compared with EH controls. However, patients with PA who underwent MRA treatment had a risk of incident ESRD similar to that of EH controls (sHR, 1.08; P = 0.570). Similarly, there was no significant difference in the risk of incident ESRD between APA and EH groups when MRA treatment was used (sHR, 0.39; P = 0.100) (Table 3).

In the subgroup analysis, there were no significant differences in incident ESRD among patients with PA after targeted treatment vs patients with EH (Fig. 2a). In terms of undergoing adrenalectomy, there was a significantly lower incidence of ESRD among patients with a Charlson score >0 (HR, 0.18; 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.71) (Fig. 2b) (a) Risk of incident ESRD between patients with PA and EH controls and (b) between patients with PA and adrenalectomy and their EH controls by participant characteristics. CVD, cardiovascular disease, NT$, New Taiwan dollar. Using the Cox regression model, we further assessed incident ESRD for patients with PA who were given MRA or adrenalectomy, with EH as the control and mortality as a competing risk (Fig. 3). A longer period of hypertension led to a similar cumulative proportion of ESRD for those given MRA (P = 0.100); however, there was a smaller cumulative proportion of ESRD for those who underwent adrenalectomy (P = 0.021) compared with patients with EH. Cox regression model comparing incident ESRD in patients with adrenalectomy (P = 0.021), MRA (P = 0.100) treatment, and EH during the follow-up period with mortality taken as a competing risk. D. Comparison of the Effect of Adrenalectomy on the Long-Term Risk of Incident ESRD Under the Framework of a Subgroup Analysis To investigate the consistency of the beneficial effect of adrenalectomy among different groups of PA patients, we conducted a subgroup analysis with respect to baseline comorbidity that further adjusted for age and sex. Our simulation results (Fig. 4) showed the beneficial effect of adrenalectomy among different treatments in patients with PA for the entire period (estimated 10 years) after index diagnosis. We found that adrenalectomy was consistently associated with a much lower long-term risk of ESRD, especially in those without residual hypertension after adrenalectomy. Patients with PA who received MRA had the highest incidence of ESRD. Future 10-y probability of freedom from ESRD events. The simulation curves were based on different scenarios of targeted treatment with MRA and adrenalectomy stratified by subsequent blood pressure. The incident ESRD was lower among patients with PA who underwent adrenalectomy, especially those without residual hypertension after adrenalectomy during follow-up. IHA, idiopathic hyperaldosteronism; OP. E. Dose-Response Relationship Between Spironolactone and the Probability of Developing Incident ESRD We further evaluated the dose-response relationship between MRA and ESRD. Targeting MRA users, we found the HR was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.67 to 0.96; P < 0.001) per defined daily dose (DDD) of MRA after adjustment for age, comorbidities, and influential drugs (c statistic 0.85; adjusted R2, 0.31). However, the GAM plot showed that the dose-response curve was nonlinear (Fig. 5). One-half to one DDD of MRA was sufficient to prevent the initiation of long-term dialysis. This favorable effect increased in a dose-response manner up to one DDD, at which point a ceiling effect was reached. The dose-response relationship between spironolactone and the probability of developing incident ESRD using generalized additive modeling. The defined daily dose (DDD) of MRA = 0.5 is equal to a daily dose of 37.5 mg. 3. Discussion A. Main Findings Regarding incident ESRD, patients with PA were comparable to those with EH after targeted treatment. We further demonstrated significantly lower incidences of ESRD and mortality in patients with PA who underwent adrenalectomy than in EH controls; no differences were seen in ESRD and mortality rates in patients with PA receiving MRA management compared with EH controls. According to our plot of 10-year probability of freedom from dialysis, prolonged duration of hypertension will increase the episode of incident ESRD. Our results show that patients with PA have a decreased incidence of ESRD after undergoing adrenalectomy, implying the importance of early diagnosis of APA and advising adrenalectomy for patients with APA and acceptable surgical risk. To the best of our knowledge, the incidence of ESRD among patients with PA has not been reported. Our report details information regarding the association between different kinds of targeted PA treatments and the incidence of ESRD (i.e., 3% as EH, with an average 5.2 years of follow-up). Coincidentally, in one retrospective study of 11,912 veterans with hypertension who were followed up for an average of 9.8 years, the estimated cumulative ESRD rate was 2.8%. A-1. Kidney function in aldosteronism Persistent hypertension and electrolyte imbalance are not the only effects of PA; a proinflammatory effect causing end-organ damage has also been observed. The glomerular hemodynamic situation in PA also occurs in intraglomerular hypertension and excessive proximal tubular sodium reabsorption, which may trigger tubuloglomerular feedback and glomerular hyperfiltration via mineralocorticoid receptor activation in macula densa cells. These data do not necessarily contradict the findings of our current study. Sodium retention\xe2\x80\x92induced hypertension results in an augmented GFR and subsequent pressure natriuresis and nephropathy, despite the potential initial adaptive value of resetting of tubuloglomerular feedback in offsetting the renal sodium-retaining actions of aldosterone for tubular injuries. Moreover, long-term excessive aldosterone concentrations have caused enduring hypertension due to increased arterial stiffness. Growing evidence supports the idea that the nonhemodynamic actions of aldosterone are responsible for small- and medium-sized arterial injuries and nephropathy, as well as interstitial and renal vascular damage. The hypertensive duration of PA is associated with heavy proteinuria and an increased renal resistance index. The activation of mineralocorticoid receptors injures podocytes and disrupts the glomerular filtration barrier, leading to proteinuria and the progression of chronic kidney disease. These findings raise the ultimate issues of early diagnosis and targeted treatment of PA with respect to kidney function. A-2. Outcome in patients with PA/APA who underwent adrenalectomy or MRA treatment Previous reports with a limited number of patients with PA showed that the subsequent rate of decline in glomerular filtration was comparable in PA and EH, whereas albuminuria did not progress in the remainder of the follow-up period. Adrenalectomy not only corrects high blood pressure and biochemical parameters but also reverses adverse vascular changes in patients with APA. This finding is also supported by the observation in a recent study that patients with PA who underwent adrenalectomy had reduced risk of mortality and lower blood pressure levels than their matched EH controls. In our analysis, the long-term solid outcome of ESRD rate decreased after surgical intervention compared with MRA treatment alone in patients with EH or PA, although decreased short-term kidney function was found in patients with APA after adrenalectomy. Improvements in renal function include microalbuminuria due to the resolution of glomerular hyperfiltration in PA after adrenalectomy. Our results suggest that patients with APA who respond to adrenalectomy demonstrate better outcomes in 10-year probability of incident ESRD than those receiving MRA alone (Fig. 3) Furthermore, in patients with PA who respond to adrenalectomy, the absence of residual hypertension is less likely to lead to ESRD. MRA treatment may induce an increase in aldosterone level and subsequently trigger a vicious cycle that leads to the insufficient effect of prescribed MRA on blocking mineralocorticoid receptors activated by the high plasma aldosterone level. On the other hand, it is likely that glucocorticoid cosecretion exists in patients with PA and at least partially contributes to associated adverse metabolic risks, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and osteoporosis. In recent studies, adrenalectomy in patients with APA decreased glucocorticoid secretion, restored osteoporosis, attenuated adverse metabolic risks, and improved quality of life, findings attributed to decreased glucocorticoid levels in addition to mineralocorticoid excess. The previously mentioned studies indicate that glucocorticoid cosecretion in PA may relate to systemic effects, which could further explain the benefits of adrenalectomy relative to MRA treatment. Our study also revealed the importance of performing a dose-response analysis of MRA use, incident ESRD, and mortality. Further concerns about MRA prescription, such as drug adherence with an inadequate dose (Fig. 4), also exist. Our additional analysis of the DDD of MRA on ESRD incidence also showed that only patients with PA who were exposed to a dose-dependent DDD >0.5 (dose equal to 37.5 mg of spironolactone) experienced decreased long-term ESRD. Dysmenorrhea and gynecomastia, presenting as adverse effects of antiandrogens, can result from spironolactone treatment, particularly in a dose-dependent relationship. These phenomena suggest that the usual doses of MRA in clinical practice may be too low; this problem warrants more attention. A-3. Hypertensive duration and outcome in patients with PA Our findings support the notion that adrenalectomy attenuates incident ESRD risk more than in patients with PA receiving MRA and in patients with EH. Patients with PA benefit from decreased blood pressure levels and use of fewer antihypertensive drugs after surgical management. Hypertension in patients with PA can decrease within 1 year after surgery; sometimes it resolves generally or improves between 1 and 6 months after adrenalectomy. As demonstrated by a prospective study, proteinuria and cystatin C (a marker of kidney function) dropped off soon after adrenalectomy but still failed to significantly decrease 1 year after the initiation of MRA treatment. Given that adrenalectomy eliminates the source of aldosterone hypersecretion on the cardiovascular system, cerebrovascular system, and kidneys, it has been fully delineated that surgery successfully improves electrolyte levels and normalizes hypertension. According to the Primary Aldosteronism Surgical Outcome study, rates of partial to complete clinical success ranged from 37% to 47%. Regarding to the incidence of ESRD, our study established the evidence that adrenalectomy decreased the risk in patients with major comorbidity, and the risk could be reduced up to 82% in those Charlsons score >0. Our result disclosed the great benefit of patients with PA and major comorbidities who receive adrenalectomy when compared with patients with EH. (Fig. 2). A-4. Strengths and limitations This study has some limitations. This was a retrospective cohort study, and some biochemical data could not be obtained. Because of characteristics of the NHI database of Taiwan, several potential confounders were lacking, including blood pressure, detailed renal function, proteinuria, and serum potassium, aldosterone, and renin levels, which are associated with response to treatment. This indeed limited our study, and further studies are needed to measure these effects. In addition, we focused on progression to ESRD after two different therapies as the renal outcome, rather than on developing or worsening of chronic kidney disease. Therefore, the absence of data such as estimated glomerular filtration rate(eGFR) and proteinuria level did not affect the renal outcome, as the registration of ESRD in the NHI database in Taiwan is credible and officially certified. Moreover, we could not identify patients with PA and bilateral adenomas or unilateral hyperplasia, as the difference between them was ambiguous and always confused by micronodules. In fact, the incidence of the two subgroups is relatively low, and our results were robust across the different models, strengthening our conclusions. The diagnostic reliability of PA and its comorbidities was validated in detail in our cohort. Moreover, our analysis considered time-varying covariates, including MRA treatment and cumulative doses of MRA as a dose-dependent covariate in the model, ensuring that patients were at risk only when they had used these drugs. Of note, the data retrieved and examined in this study came from health insurance registrations, for which diagnostic tests were not controlled as ideally as some single or multicenter clinical studies could have easily achieved. Nevertheless, these are real-life data with completed medical records that allowed us to scrutinize some large-scale, long-term follow-up outcomes in patients with PA among a population of 23 million people, according to ICD-9 diagnostic and current procedural terminology(CPT) coding. We believe this big data approach offers important insights into the understanding of PA, which has not been examined and could not be offered with smaller-scale multicenter studies. Further prospective trials are warranted to confirm the significantly beneficial effect of adrenalectomy on incident ESRD among patients with PA. 4. Conclusion Although patients with PA had an incidence of ESRD compatible with that of patients with EH after targeted treatment, our results highlight the importance of early diagnosis of PA and appropriate adrenalectomy for patients who are suitable for surgery to lower the risk of long-term incident ESRD and improve survival. MRA management did not provide comparable renal function and survival advantages. Further prospective studies are necessary to confirm our results.

Key Points
Question
Can the risk of patients with primary aldosteronism developing atrial fibrillation be lowered with mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists or surgical adrenalectomy?
Findings
In this large cohort study, patients with primary aldosteronism treated with MR antagonists had a 2.5-fold higher risk for incident atrial fibrillation when their renin remained suppressed (a marker of insufficient MR blockade) compared with matched patients with essential hypertension. In contrast, patients with primary aldosteronism whose renin substantially increased with MR antagonists and patients who underwent surgical adrenalectomy had no significant difference in incident atrial fibrillation risk compared with an age-matched cohort of patients with essential hypertension.
Meaning
Activation of the MR by aldosterone may play an important role in the development of atrial fibrillation, and adequate blockade or removal of this aldosterone may prevent incident atrial fibrillation.
This cohort study investigates whether mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy or surgical adrenalectomy in patients with primary aldosteronism influences their risk for incident atrial fibrillation.

Abstract
Importance
Primary aldosteronism (PA) is an ideal condition to evaluate the role of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF).
Objective
To investigate whether MR antagonist therapy or surgical adrenalectomy in PA influence the risk for incident AF.
Design
This cohort study included patients aged 18 years and older. Patients with PA and age-matched patients with essential hypertension were identified via electronic health records. Patients with a history of AF, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or stroke were excluded. Data were collected between 1991 and the end of 2016 in an academic medical center, with a mean follow-up duration of approximately 8 years.
Exposures
Patients with PA treated with MR antagonists or surgical adrenalectomy were compared with patients with essential hypertension. Patients with PA who were treated with MR antagonists were categorized by whether their plasma renin activity remained suppressed (<_1 ng/mL/h) or substantially increased (â¥_1 ng/mL/h), as proxies for insufficient or sufficient MR blockade.
Main Outcomes and Measure
Incident AF.
Results
A total of 195 patients with PA who were treated with MR antagonists and 201 patients with PA treated with surgical adrenalectomy were included, as well as 40_092 age-matched patients with essential hypertension. Despite similar blood pressure at study entry and throughout follow-up, patients with PA who were treated with MR antagonists whose renin remained suppressed had a higher risk for incident AF than patients with essential hypertension (adjusted HR, 2.55 [95% CI, 1.75-3.71]). They also had an adjusted 10-year cumulative AF incidence difference of 14.1 (95% CI, 6.7-21.5) excess cases per 100 persons compared with patients with essential hypertension. In contrast, patients with PA who were treated with MR antagonists and whose renin increased and patients with PA who were treated with surgical adrenalectomy had no statistically significant difference in risk for incident AF compared with patients with essential hypertension.
Conclusions and Relevance
When compared with patients with essential hypertension, patients with PA treated with MR antagonists such that renin remained suppressed (as a proxy for insufficient MR blockade) had a significantly higher risk for incident AF; however, treatment of PA with MR antagonists to substantially increase renin (suggesting sufficient MR blockade), or with surgical adrenalectomy (to remove the source of aldosteronism), was associated with no significant difference in risk for developing AF. These findings add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that MR blockade may be a potential therapy to decrease the incidence of AF.

Introduction
Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia; it increases the risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes such as stroke and reduced cardiac output. Prior studies have demonstrated that long-term aldosterone exposure promotes the development of atrial fibrillation by inducing cardiac fibrosis and conduction disturbances via activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR).1,2,3,4,5,6,7 Recent evidence suggests that blockade of the MR with medications such as spironolactone and eplerenone may provide a new therapeutic approach to prevent or delay the development of atrial fibrillation.8,9,10
Primary aldosteronism (PA), a state of autonomous aldosterone secretion,11 offers a classic example of the detrimental effects of chronic and excessive MR activation on the development of atrial fibrillation. Untreated patients with PA have a 3.5-fold higher risk for incident atrial fibrillation compared with patients with similar blood pressures.12 Although adrenalectomy as a treatment for PA is associated with decreased risk for atrial fibrillation when compared with patients with essential hypertension,7 the risk for atrial fibrillation despite lifelong MR antagonist therapy has been reported as high.7,13 Herein, we conduct a large retrospective cohort study that includes physiologic biomarkers of medical treatment efficacy to examine the risk for incident atrial fibrillation in patients with PA who were treated with MR antagonists or surgical adrenalectomy, compared with patients with essential hypertension.

Methods
We performed a cohort study of patients with PA and patients with essential hypertension using the electronic health records at Brigham and Womenâs Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, and their affiliated partner hospitals (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).13 Eligibility for the current analyses required that patients had to be seen between 1991 and 2016 and be 18 years or older. Entry into the study was defined by condition: for patients with PA treated with MR antagonists, by the date of the first plasma renin activity (PRA) measurement at least 1 month after starting MR antagonist therapy; for patients with PA treated with surgical adrenalectomy, by the first follow-up visit 1 to 6 months after undergoing surgical adrenalectomy; and for patients with essential hypertension, by the first follow-up visit 1 to 6 months after the diagnosis of essential hypertension was first entered into the medical record.
This study was approved by the Partners Healthcare System institutional review board. A waiver of informed consent was granted to develop this deidentified cohort.
Patients with PA who were treated with MR antagonists were subdivided by whether PRA remained suppressed at the first measurement at least 1 month after starting MR antagonist therapy (where suppression was defined as <_1 ng/mL/h) or increased substantially to become unsuppressed (â¥_1 ng/mL/h). These test results were considered proxies for insufficient and sufficient blockade, respectively, of the MR in PA.
Patients were excluded if they had a history of atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization, transient ischemic attack or stroke, or congestive heart failure hospitalization prior to study entry. Patients with PA who were treated with MR antagonists who and did not have PRA measurements at least 1 month after initiating treatment were also excluded. Patients with essential hypertension were also excluded if they were treated with MR antagonists at study entry. The population with essential hypertension was frequency-matched by decade of age at study entry to the study population with PA who were treated with MR antagonists.
The analysis investigated the risk for incident atrial fibrillation among patients with PA who were treated with MR antagonists or surgical adrenalectomy compared with patients with essential hypertension. We used multivariate Cox regression models (using the PHREG procedure in SAS version 9.4 [SAS Institute]) to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. All models were adjusted for the following covariates at the time of study entry: age, sex, race, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), diabetes mellitus, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and systolic blood pressure. Patients were censored on the date of incident atrial fibrillation or, if they did not develop atrial fibrillation, on the date of their final follow-up visit. All P values are 2-sided and considered significant if .05 or less. A more detailed description of the study cohort, exposure definition, outcome ascertainment, and statistical analysis is available in the eMethods in the Supplement.

Results
A total of 195 patients with PA who were treated with MR antagonists (including 130 whose PRA remained suppressed and 65 whose PRA substantially increased to unsuppressed levels), 201 patients with PA treated with surgical adrenalectomy, and 40_092 patients with essential hypertension were included in the study. Compared with patients with essential hypertension, patients with PA who were treated with MR antagonists were by design of similar age (patients treated with MR antagonists with suppressed PRA: mean [SD] age, 57.1 [12.3] years; patients treated with MR antagonists with PRA at an unsuppressed level: 56.6 [13.0] years; patients with essential hypertension: 56.8 [11.8] years); in contrast, patients with PA treated surgically were younger (mean [SD] age, 49.3 [10.9] years; Table 1). Patients with PA who were treated surgically had a more severe biochemical PA phenotype compared with patients with PA who were treated with MR antagonists (patients treated with MR antagonists with suppressed PRA: median [interquartile range] serum aldosterone levels, 19.0 [13.0-42.6] ng/dL; patients treated with MR antagonists with PRA at an unsuppressed level: 23.0 [17.0-30.0] ng/dL; surgically treated patients: 30.6 [21.3-46.0] ng/dL). Patients with PA had higher blood pressure prior to study entry (patients with suppressed PRA: mean [SD] systolic blood pressure, 149 [18] mm Hg; patients with PRA at an unsuppressed level: 146[16] mm Hg; surgically treated patients: 145 [17] mm Hg) than patients with essential hypertension (mean [SD] systolic blood pressure, 138 [19] mm Hg); however, at the time of study entry and throughout the follow-up period, blood pressure was similar between patients with PA and those with essential hypertension (patients treated with MR antagonists with suppressed PRA: mean [SD] systolic blood pressure at study entry, 139 [21] mm Hg; patients treated with MR antagonists with PRA at an unsuppressed level: 133 [16] mm Hg; surgically treated patients: 133 [16] mm Hg; patients with essential hypertension: 135 [18] mm Hg; eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Patients with PA whose PRA level became unsuppressed with MR antagonist therapy were prescribed higher-potency equivalents of MR antagonists than patients with PA whose PRA had remained suppressed (by a measure in which mean MRA equivalent potency was calculated by combining spironolactone and eplerenone doses into a single value, with spironolactone considered to be twice the potency of eplerenone; patients with unsuppressed PRA: initial dose: mean [SD], 95 [52] mg/day; maximum dose: 161 [113] mg/day; patients with suppressed PRA: initial dose: mean [SD], 77 [53] mg/day; maximum dose: 149 [135] mg/day; Table 1).
Patients with PA who were treated with MR antagonists and whose PRA remained suppressed had a higher risk for incident atrial fibrillation compared with patients with essential hypertension (adjusted HR, 2.55 [95% CI, 1.75-3.71]) (Figure). In contrast, patients with PA who were treated with MR antagonists and whose PRA rose to become unsuppressed had no statistically significant difference in risk for incident atrial fibrillation compared with patients with essential hypertension (adjusted HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.54-2.00]); the same was true for patients with PA who were treated with surgical adrenalectomy (adjusted HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.41-1.36]) (Figure; eTable 1 and eTable 2 in the Supplement).
The adjusted 10-year cumulative incidence difference for developing incident atrial fibrillation indicated that patients with PA who were treated with MR antagonists and whose PRA remained suppressed had 14.1 (95% CI, 6.7-21.5) excess cases of atrial fibrillation per 100 persons than patients with essential hypertension (Table 2). In contrast, patients with PA who were treated with MR antagonists and whose PRA became unsuppressed, and patients with PA who were treated with surgical adrenalectomy, had no significant difference in the adjusted 10-year cumulative incidence of atrial fibrillation.
Discussion
The findings in this study expand the evidence implicating aldosterone and the MR in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation. Without targeted treatment, PA is associated with a 3.5-fold higher risk for developing atrial fibrillation than essential hypertension, independent of blood pressure.12 We previously showed that even when MR antagonists are used in PA, the risk for atrial fibrillation in these patients is 1.9-fold higher than in patients with essential hypertension.13 However, the current analyses demonstrate that this risk may be modified by the way medical treatment is implemented: when PA is treated with MR antagonists such that renin remains suppressed, the risk for developing atrial fibrillation is 2.5-fold higher than in age-matched patients with essential hypertension and similar blood pressures. In contrast, treating PA with MR antagonists to induce a substantial increase in renin or with surgery to remove the source of autonomous aldosterone secretion results in no significant difference in the risk for developing atrial fibrillation. Renin suppression in PA is a result of excessive MR activation and sodium and volume expansion,11,14 and the increase in renin with MR antagonist therapy reflects sufficient antagonism of the MR and decreased sodium reabsorption and volume contraction. Indeed, an increase in renin with MR antagonists in PA has previously been shown to be associated with a lower risk for myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and death.13
The current study provides clinically relevant evidence from an extreme state of hyperaldosteronism that using MR antagonists to adequately block the MR, or removal of the unilateral source of aldosterone excess via surgical adrenalectomy, may mitigate the excess risk for atrial fibrillation attributed to pathologic MR activation. These findings are in agreement with recent studies in essential hypertension and heart failure,8,9,10,15 which suggest that blockade of the MR may be a potential target for preventing or delaying the incidence of atrial fibrillation and stroke. Our findings may also help contextualize prior studies in cohorts with PA that did not include an evaluation of physiological biomarkers of MR blockade and observed that lifelong MR antagonist therapy did not lower the risk for atrial fibrillation, whereas surgical adrenalectomy did.7
Limitations
Our results must be interpreted within the limitations of this observational study design. Despite blood pressure and other risk factors being similar at study entry and our models adjusting for important confounders, there may still be residual confounding and misclassification. Although the population of patients with PA was relatively large compared with prior cohort studies in PA, the absolute sample sizes of the study populations were still small and could therefore limit the reliability of our conclusions. Although we performed extensive medical record reviews to confirm the atrial fibrillation outcomes, the reliance on medical record documentation for this ascertainment cannot completely exclude some misclassification. Because this study used an open cohort design, we could not capture all atrial fibrillation events that occurred outside of our health care system, which may have resulted in an underestimation of cumulative incidence rates. Patients with PA who were treated with surgery were on average 7 years younger than the other exposure groups, a reflection of the fact that unilateral PA is often more severe and presents earlier in life. However, our models were adjusted for age, and the comparisons using the surgical exposure can be considered to strengthen the differences observed among patients treated with MR antagonists, who were matched by age to patients with essential hypertension. Finally, we defined renin suppression using a binary categorization, rather than using a continuous analysis of renin values, because most patients with PA had renin activity values that were below the lower limit of the assay (0.60 ng/mL/h).

Conclusions
In conclusion, the excess risk for atrial fibrillation that is attributed to aldosterone-MR interactions in PA may be mitigated by MR antagonist therapy that sufficiently blocks aldosterone or by surgical adrenalectomy to remove the source of aldosterone excess. These findings provide additional support for the role of aldosterone and the MR in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation and support further investigations to evaluate whether MR antagonists may be an effective option to prevent the onset of atrial fibrillation in the general hypertension population."

Whether these treatments mitigate the risk for kidney disease remains unknown. We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with PA treated with MRAs (N=400) or surgical adrenalectomy (N=120), and age- and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)-matched patients with essential hypertension (N=15,474) to determine risk for chronic kidney disease and longitudinal eGFR decline. Despite similar blood pressures, patients with PA treated with MRAs had a higher risk for incident chronic kidney disease compared with essential hypertension patients (adjusted HR 1.63 [95% CI 1.33, 1.99]). Correspondingly, the adjusted annual decline in eGFR was greater in PA patients treated with MRAs compared with essential hypertension patients (\xe2\x88\x921.6 [95% CI \xe2\x88\x921.4, \xe2\x88\x921.8] vs. \xe2\x88\x920.9 [95% CI \xe2\x88\x920.9, \xe2\x88\x921.0] mL/min/1.73 m2/year, p < 0.001). In contrast, patients with unilateral PA treated with surgical adrenalectomy had no significant difference in risk for incident chronic kidney disease or in annual decline in eGFR compared with essential hypertension patients. Among PA patients with diabetes treated with MRAs, there was a higher risk for incident albuminuria compared with essential hypertension (adjusted HR 2.52 [95% CI 1.28, 4.96]). MRA therapy in PA is associated with higher risk for developing chronic kidney disease, when compared with essential hypertension, and surgical adrenalectomy may mitigate this risk. When possible, curative surgical adrenalectomy may be superior to lifelong MRA therapy in preventing kidney disease in PA. Introduction Primary aldosteronism (PA), a disorder of renin-independent aldosterone secretion, is the most common cause of endocrine hypertension and increases the risk for cardiovascular and renal disease, independent of blood pressure, via excessive activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Recent studies suggest that 4-19% of patients with hypertension and 3-14% of patients with normotension may have PA, thus the global prevalence of patients with unrecognized PA who are at high risk for adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes is considered to be high. Excessive aldosterone exposure is known to result in progressive renal injury by inducing renal fibrosis, vascular disease, and podocyte injury. Early in the disease process, excessive MR activation in primary aldosteronism results in increased intravascular volume and hyperfiltration as evidenced by an increased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Cross-sectional studies suggest that this initial hyperfiltration is followed by a more rapid decline in eGFR and increased albuminuria due to the chronic effects of the aldosterone-MR interaction. Although MR antagonists and surgical adrenalectomy are the expert consensus recommended therapies for PA, whether they adequately preserve GFR, and reduce the risk for developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and albuminuria is not well understood. Prior human studies to evaluate the effect of PA therapies on renal outcomes have been small in size and observed no significant differences in long-term GFR decline or albuminuria progression, suggesting that medical and surgical therapies for PA may be similarly adequate at mitigating the risk for kidney disease in PA. Due to the high prevalence and associated renal morbidity of PA, there is a vital need for large longitudinal studies to examine the comparative efficacies of recommended treatments for PA in reducing the risk for adverse renal outcomes. Recent large cohort studies have shown that even when PA patients are treated with MR antagonists to reduce blood pressure, they have a substantially higher risk for developing cardiovascular events and death when compared to similar patients with essential hypertension and PA patients who undergo surgical adrenalectomy. Herein, we conducted a large cohort study to examine the risk for incident CKD, eGFR decline, and incident albuminuria in patients with PA treated with MR antagonists and surgical adrenalectomy compared with patients with essential hypertension who were of similar age and had comparable baseline eGFR and blood pressure. Methods The data and analytic methods that support the findings of this study can be requested from the corresponding author by qualified researchers trained in human subject confidentiality protocols and with institutional ethics board approval. The study procedures comply with the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the Partners Healthcare System Institutional Review Board Protocol. Data Source and Study Cohort The study cohort was derived from a research registry of all patients at Brigham and Women\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, and their affiliated partner hospitals (Figure 1). Eligibility for the study required that patients had to be seen between the years 1991-2016 and be \xe2\x89\xa5 18 years of age. Entry into the study was defined as the date of the first follow-up visit 1-6 months after initiating an MR antagonist (for PA patients treated with MR antagonists), after undergoing surgical adrenalectomy (for PA patients treated surgically), or after the diagnosis of essential hypertension was first entered into the medical record (for essential hypertension patients). The registry was searched for all potential patients with PA using International Classification of Disease, 9th and 10th Revisions (ICD-9 and ICD-10) codes as well as using the following text search terms: \xe2\x80\x9cprimary aldosteronism\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cprimary hyperaldosteronism\xe2\x80\x9d, and \xe2\x80\x9cConn\xe2\x80\x99s Syndrome\xe2\x80\x9d. Manual medical record review was performed by two experts (please see the online supplement at http://hyper.ahajournals.org) to exclude patients whose baseline laboratory criteria were inconsistent with the diagnosis of PA (Figure 1). Patients with PA were then categorized by whether they were treated with MR antagonists or surgical adrenalectomy as recommended by The Endocrine Society. PA patients treated with medical therapy were further excluded if they had an eGFR at study entry of < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, had no serum creatinine measurements at least 1 year after initiating MR antagonist therapy, or were not treated with MR antagonists. PA patients treated with surgical adrenalectomy were excluded if they had an eGFR at study entry of < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or had no serum creatinine measurements at least 1 year after undergoing surgical adrenalectomy. There were 400 patients with PA treated with MR antagonist medications and 120 patients with PA treated with surgical adrenalectomy, all without pre-existing CKD, included in the study. The registry was then searched for patients with essential hypertension using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes while excluding any diagnosis of PA. Essential hypertension patients were excluded if they had an eGFR at study entry of < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, had no serum creatinine measurements at least 1 year after initial ICD-9 or ICD-10 coding for essential hypertension, or were treated with MR antagonist medications. The essential hypertension population was frequency matched by decade of age and eGFR at study entry to the PA study population treated with MR antagonist therapy. There were 15474 patients with essential hypertension without pre-existing CKD included in the study (Figure 1). Definition of Exposure For the primary analysis, the main exposure was the diagnosis of PA subdivided by treatment with either MR antagonists or surgical adrenalectomy. The primary comparison group was patients with essential hypertension who were frequency matched by age and eGFR at study entry to the PA patients treated with MR antagonists. For more detailed explanation on exposure definitions, please see the online supplement at http://hyper.ahajournals.org. Definition of Covariates The following covariates at the time of study entry were considered as potential confounders: age, sex, race, history of diabetes mellitus, history of cardiovascular disease (defined as prior myocardial infarction/coronary revascularization, transient ischemic attack/stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure), eGFR, systolic blood pressure, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker use. Definition of Outcomes The primary outcome was incident CKD defined as the combination of a decrease in eGFR to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in addition to an overall decline in eGFR of \xe2\x89\xa5 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 from the value at study entry. eGFR values were calculated via the CKD-EPI equation using the serum creatinine measurements closest (+/\xe2\x88\x92 3 months) to the following times after study entry: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10 years. Secondary outcomes were the longitudinal changes in eGFR and incident albuminuria. We defined albuminuria as a spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) \xe2\x89\xa5 30 mg/g. Since albuminuria was not routinely measured in all patients with essential hypertension, the albuminuria analysis was restricted to only patients with diabetes mellitus, where routine measure of albuminuria is standard of practice, and who had a UACR < 30 mg/g at study entry (N=26 for PA treated with MR antagonists, N=578 for essential hypertension). Patients with PA treated with surgical adrenalectomy were not included in the albuminuria analysis as there were a very small number of eligible patients with diabetes mellitus and a UACR < 30 mg/g at study entry (N=5). Statistical Analysis The primary analysis investigated whether patients treated for PA with MR antagonists or surgery had a higher risk of incident CKD compared with patients with essential hypertension. Secondary analyses investigated: 1) the longitudinal change in mean eGFR between these three populations; and 2) the risk for incident albuminuria among diabetic patients. We used adjusted Cox regression models (proc PHREG in SAS v9.4, Cary, NC) to estimate adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. The proportional hazard assumption was evaluated by testing significance of the exposure-time interactions in the Cox models. The standardized cumulative incidence of CKD was one minus a standardized survival function (proc PHREG baseline statement in SAS v9.4), which was estimated by averaging the estimated individual-specific survival curves based on the multivariate Cox models mentioned above over the distributions of the aforementioned covariates in the cohort. We used this model to calculate differences in standardized cumulative incidence of CKD at 2, 5, and 10 years of follow-up between patients with PA treated with MR antagonists, patients with PA treated with surgical adrenalectomy, and patients with essential hypertension. For the secondary analysis investigating the longitudinal change in mean eGFR, we used multivariate repeated measures models (proc MIXED in SAS v9.4) to determine differences in the slope of eGFR decline between patients with PA and patients with essential hypertension. Patients were censored on the date of the specified outcome occurrence or, if they did not develop the outcome, at the date of the final serum creatinine (for the CKD and eGFR analyses) or UACR (for the albuminuria analysis) measurement. All p-values are two-sided. Results Patient Characteristics Compared with patients with essential hypertension, PA patients treated with MR antagonists had, by design, similar age and eGFR at study entry but were more likely to be black, have diabetes mellitus, have pre-existing cardiovascular disease, have lower serum potassium, and be prescribed potassium supplementation (Table 1). PA patients treated surgically were younger, had less pre-existing cardiovascular disease, and had a biochemically more severe PA phenotype (Table 1). At the time of study entry and throughout the duration of the study, the mean baseline blood pressures were comparable between patients with PA and essential hypertension (Figure 2). The number of prescribed antihypertensive medications, not including MR antagonists, was also similar amongst the groups; however, PA patients were less likely to be prescribed potassium-wasting diuretics and more likely to be prescribed potassium-sparing diuretics compared with patients with essential hypertension (Table 1). Dynamic confirmatory testing was employed in the majority of patients, whereas a minority had sufficiently suggestive screening diagnostics to confirm the diagnosis of PA (Table 1). Adrenal venous sampling was used to make treatment decisions in most surgical patients (83%), but only slightly more than half of medically treated PA patients (55%) (Table 1). Risk for Incident Chronic Kidney Disease PA patients treated with MR antagonists had a higher rate of incident CKD compared with PA patients treated surgically and patients with essential hypertension (55.6 [95% CI 45.8, 66.8] vs. 16.7 [95% CI 8.3, 29.9] vs. 35.6 [34.4, 36.9] events per 1,000 person years). After accounting for blood pressure and other confounders, PA patients treated with MR antagonists had a higher risk for incident CKD compared with both PA patients treated surgically (adjusted HR 2.30 [95% CI 1.22, 4.35]) and patients with essential hypertension (adjusted HR 1.63 [95% CI 1.33, 1.99]) (Figure 3). There was no significant difference in risk for incident CKD comparing PA patients treated surgically with patients with essential hypertension (adjusted HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.39, 1.30]) (Figure 3). The adjusted 10-year cumulative incidence difference for developing CKD indicated that PA patients treated with MR antagonists had 17.9 (95% CI 6.5, 29.2) excess cases of CKD per 100 persons compared with PA patients treated surgically and 11.4 (95% CI 6.2, 16.5) excess cases of CKD per 100 persons compared with patients with essential hypertension (Table 2). These results did not materially change when the analysis was restricted to only PA patients with bilateral PA confirmed by adrenal vein sampling (AVS) and treated with MR antagonists (N=153) and only PA patients with unilateral PA confirmed by AVS and treated with surgery (N=98) (Figure S1, please see online supplement at http://hyper.ahajournals.org). Among the PA patients treated with MR antagonists, there was no significant difference in incident CKD (adjusted HR 1.07 [95% CI 0.53, 2.19]) between those whose first plasma renin activity level, measured at least one month after initiating MR antagonist therapy, became unsuppressed (\xe2\x89\xa5 1.0 ng/mL/h, N=43) compared with those whose plasma renin activity level remained suppressed (< 1.0 ng/mL/h, N=104). Longitudinal Change in Mean Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate Although PA patients had an expected higher eGFR prior to initiation of any treatments, once therapy was initiated at the time of study entry, medical and surgical PA patients and those with essential hypertension had similar mean eGFR measurements (83.5 [16.6] vs. 85.5 [16.2] vs. 83.6 [16.7] mL/min/1.73 m2) (Figure 4). The adjusted mean annual decline in eGFR was greater in patients with PA treated with MR antagonists compared with patients with essential hypertension (\xe2\x88\x921.6 [95% CI \xe2\x88\x921.4, \xe2\x88\x921.8] vs. \xe2\x88\x920.9 [95% CI \xe2\x88\x920.9, \xe2\x88\x921.0] mL/min/1.73 m2/yr, p < 0.001). In contrast, there was no significant difference in adjusted mean annual decline in eGFR between patients with PA treated with surgical adrenalectomy and patients with essential hypertension (\xe2\x88\x920.8 [95% CI \xe2\x88\x920.5, \xe2\x88\x921.2] vs. \xe2\x88\x920.9 [95% CI \xe2\x88\x920.9, \xe2\x88\x921.0] mL/min/1.73 m2/yr, p = 0.53) (Figure 4). Risk for Incident Albuminuria There was a higher risk for developing incident albuminuria among diabetic PA patients treated with MR antagonists compared with diabetic patients with essential hypertension (adjusted HR 2.52 [95% CI 1.28, 4.96]) (Figure S2, please see online supplement at http://hyper.ahajournals.org). Discussion Although medical therapy with MR antagonists is generally assumed to be efficacious and is widely used to treat PA, the current study demonstrates that even when PA patients were treated with MR antagonists to achieve similar blood pressures as patients with essential hypertension, they had a 63% higher risk for incident CKD, a faster longitudinal decline in eGFR, and a higher rate of albuminuria among patients with diabetes. In contrast, when patients with unilateral PA were treated with surgical adrenalectomy, the decline in eGFR and risk for incident CKD were not significantly different from patients with essential hypertension. These findings suggest that the current, and officially recommended, practice of MR antagonist therapy to block the effects of aldosterone in PA may not adequately mitigate the excess risk for adverse renal outcomes. In contrast, surgical therapy targeted to eliminate the source of autonomous aldosterone excess is associated with the same risk for kidney disease as comparable patients with essential hypertension. There are several other clinical lessons that are suggested in these findings. First, the hyperfiltration in untreated PA may give clinicians the false security that their patients have normal kidney function; treatment of PA with MR antagonists or surgery rapidly unmasks underlying reductions in eGFR to reveal that many PA patients have much poorer kidney function than initially perceived (Figure 4). Second, since the medical treatment of PA with MR antagonists is associated with a risk for hyperkalemia, rapid longitudinal declines in eGFR may force clinicians to decrease MR antagonist doses to avoid hyperkalemia, thus resulting in a vicious cycle of inadequate aldosterone blockade and higher risk of MR-mediated kidney disease. Third, the current findings again highlight the deleterious effects of aldosterone excess and MR activation on the kidney at the patient-level. Finally, because these findings suggest that reliance on lifelong MR antagonist therapy in PA may not adequately prevent kidney disease, they should trigger a broader conversation on how to candidly counsel PA patients who choose to undergo medical therapy about the efficacy and future risk associated with this decision, and on the design of new studies and guidelines to address whether surgical adrenalectomy should be considered more frequently. Prior to this study, there had been a paucity of literature on the effectiveness of MR antagonists and/or surgical adrenalectomy in reducing the incidence of adverse renal outcomes. Sechi et al. performed the most influential study in this regard, a prospective study of 50 patients with PA treated with either spironolactone or surgical adrenalectomy and 100 patients with essential hypertension with similar blood pressures and measured longitudinal trends in GFR and albuminuria. The study showed that GFR and albuminuria declined in the 6 months after treatment initiation, presumptively due to reversal of the hyperfiltration effect in untreated PA, with a subsequent rate of change in GFR and albuminuria that was not significantly different between patients with PA and patients with essential hypertension. Although one interpretation of these findings was that treatment of PA, with either MR antagonists or surgery, resulted in similar renal outcomes as comparable essential hypertensives, notable limitations included the small sample size and aggregation of medical and surgical treatments of PA rather than comparing their renal outcomes separately, as we did. In this regard, our current findings represent a substantial advance from prior studies. The previous lack of large, robust prospective data assessing the effectiveness of MR antagonists and surgical adrenalectomy on renal outcomes in PA has limited the ability to make specific recommendations regarding the optimal treatment approach in PA. It has remained unclear whether, in patients with PA with disease amenable to surgical treatment, adrenalectomy improves long-term outcomes compared with MR antagonist use. Our prior study investigating cardiovascular outcomes in PA showed that surgical therapy for PA was associated with significantly lower risk of cardiovascular outcomes and death when compared with PA patients treated with MR antagonists. Collectively, these findings suggest that when a patient with PA has unilateral disease that is amenable to cure with surgery, and is healthy enough to undergo surgery, adrenalectomy is the optimal treatment to improve long-term health outcomes. In contrast, treatment of PA with MR antagonists may not adequately lower the risk of adverse renal outcomes when compared with similar patients with essential hypertension. Whether this is due to inadequate blockade of the MR with MR antagonist medications (e.g. inadequate dosing), inability to maximally titrate MR antagonists due to declining eGFR, lack of compliance with medications, or other reasons, could not be directly assessed in our study. In the context of these findings, it may be worth considering whether unilateral adrenalectomy to attenuate the severity of PA in patients with bilateral disease might be an effective approach; future studies dedicated to this objective would be needed to ascertain how best to mitigate renal risk in PA patients with bilateral adrenal disease. It should be noted that in our prior study on cardiovascular outcomes in PA, achieving an unsuppressed renin activity level during MR antagonist therapy was associated with a substantially lower risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes compared with having a persistently suppressed renin activity level, an observation suggesting that a rise in renin may serve as a biomarker for sufficient volume contraction and/or MR blockade. In contrast, the current study showed no association between renin activity and incident CKD. The most obvious explanation for this discrepancy is the intimate and paradoxical physiologic connection between the exposure of renin activity and the renal outcomes that relied on eGFR. Untreated PA results in volume expansion, renin suppression, hyperfiltration, and higher eGFR; in contrast, adequate treatment of aldosterone excess may abrogate the volume expansion and hyperfiltration and can result in a rise in renin but a decline in eGFR. Thus, the nature of this interdependent relationship, in addition to the small sample size of patients with longitudinal renin measurements and potential heterogeneity in MRA responses over time, may have limited the ability of renin activity to serve as a useful biomarker for renal outcomes. Our results must be interpreted within the context of the study design. First, this study was observational. Although blood pressure, medication use, and other risk factors were similar at the time of study entry and our models adjusted for important confounders, there might still be residual confounding and misclassification. Second, our observational study design did not prospectively control blood pressure in each exposure group and could not completely account for the severity and duration of hypertension prior to study entry. However, upon initiation of either medical or surgical therapy at study entry, blood pressure control and use of non-MR antagonist anti-hypertensive medications were comparable between PA and essential hypertension patients, the longitudinal blood pressure control was comparable, and our models adjusted for the treated blood pressure at study entry. Third, the PA patients who received surgical therapy were on average 6 years younger than those with essential hypertension; however, other risk factors (including BMI, baseline eGFR and baseline blood pressure) were comparable and our models were adjusted for age. Fourth, eGFR is an imperfect marker of kidney disease as its magnitude is influenced by other variables such as hemodynamic effects from volume expansion/hyperfiltration which was demonstrated by the substantial initial decline in eGFR in PA patients after starting MR antagonist therapy or undergoing surgical adrenalectomy. However, PA patients did not enter into our study until after starting MR antagonist therapy or undergoing surgical adrenalectomy, and our data still demonstrate longitudinal and persistent differences in eGFR trends between patients with PA and essential hypertension. Fifth, a recent expert consensus study proposed criteria for classifying surgical cure of PA; however, our study did not have sufficient power, or consistent information throughout the study period, to evaluate the clinical relevance of these criteria on renal outcomes. Finally, the methodology of comparing treated PA patients with essential hypertension patients can be debated since this approach includes indication bias by treatment and different underlying pathologies. However, our study design was limited by the current standard of care practices dictated by expert guidelines, and prioritized the assessment of renal outcomes, independent of blood pressure, when treatment was directed to block aldosterone, versus eliminate the source of aldosterone, versus having no excess aldosterone. In this regard, our findings have direct implications for the current recommended practices in PA.

Standardized to the distributions at the time of study entry in our cohort for the following variables: age, sex, race/ethnicity, diabetes mellitus, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker use, pre-existing cardiovascular disease, and systolic blood pressure. Perspectives PA is characterized by autonomous aldosterone secretion that results in excessive MR activation and earlier and more prominent renal damage compared with essential hypertension. MR antagonists and surgical adrenalectomy are the expert consensus recommended therapies for PA; however, this study demonstrates that even when patients with PA are treated with MR antagonists to achieve similar blood pressure control, they have a more rapid decline in eGFR, higher incidence of CKD, and an increased incidence of albuminuria among patients with diabetes, when compared with similar patients with essential hypertension. In contrast, surgical adrenalectomy to cure PA is associated with no significant differences in eGFR decline or CKD incidence compared with essential hypertension. When possible, surgical adrenalectomy to attenuate or cure hyperaldosteronism may be superior to MR antagonist therapy in mitigating the risk for kidney disease. Future studies should investigate new approaches to improving the efficacy of MR antagonist therapy and/or reconsidering the indications for using surgical adrenalectomy.

Whether this recommendation effectively reduces cardiovascular risk is not well understood. Methods We conducted a cohort study including 602 PA patients treated with MRAs and 41853 age-matched patients with essential hypertension (EH) to investigate the risk for incident cardiovascular events (composite of myocardial infarction, heart failure hospitalization, stroke), atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and death in patients with PA compared with EH. Findings Both groups had comparable cardiovascular risk profiles and blood pressures throughout the study. The incidence rate of cardiovascular events was higher among PA patients on MRAs compared with EH: 56\xc2\xb73 (48\xc2\xb78, 64\xc2\xb77) versus 26\xc2\xb76 (26\xc2\xb71, 27\xc2\xb72) events per 1,000 person-years (adjusted HR=1\xc2\xb791 [1\xc2\xb763, 2\xc2\xb725]; adjusted 10-year cumulative incidence difference: 14\xc2\xb71 [10\xc2\xb71, 18\xc2\xb70] excess events per 100 persons). PA patients also had higher adjusted risks for incident mortality (HR=1\xc2\xb734 [1\xc2\xb706, 1\xc2\xb771]), diabetes (HR=1\xc2\xb726 [1\xc2\xb701, 1\xc2\xb757]), and atrial fibrillation (HR=1\xc2\xb793 [1\xc2\xb754, 2\xc2\xb742]). Compared with EH, the excess risk for cardiovascular events and mortality was limited to PA patients whose renin activity remained suppressed (<1 \xc2\xb5g/L/h) on MRAs (adjusted HR=2\xc2\xb783 [2\xc2\xb711, 3\xc2\xb780] and 1\xc2\xb779 [1\xc2\xb714, 2\xc2\xb780] respectively) whereas patients who were treated with higher MRA doses and had unsuppressed renin (\xe2\x89\xa51 \xc2\xb5g/L/h) had no significant excess risk. Interpretation Current practice of MRA therapy in PA is associated with significantly higher risk for incident cardiometabolic events and death independent of blood pressure control. Targeting MRA therapy to raise renin may mitigate this excess risk. Funding National Institutes of Health Introduction Primary aldosteronism (PA), characterized by autonomous aldosterone secretion that is independent of renin, increases the risk for cardiovascular and metabolic disease via activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). It is estimated that 4\xe2\x80\x9319% of patients with hypertension, and 3\xe2\x80\x9314% of patients with normotension, may have PA. Although a notable subset of patients with PA have disease that can be cured by surgical adrenalectomy, the majority of patients with PA are treated medically with MR antagonists. Although MR antagonists are the expert consensus recommended medical therapy for PA, there are no large longitudinal or intervention studies demonstrating the efficacy of MR antagonists for reducing the risk for cardiovascular or metabolic diseases in PA, nor any specific guidelines regarding optimal treatment targets when prescribing MR antagonists for PA. Prior studies have suggested that MR antagonist therapy for PA may not effectively reduce cardiometabolic risk; however, these have been small case-control studies or longitudinal cohort studies with low event rates. Herein, we conducted a large cohort study to investigate the risk for incident cardiometabolic outcomes and death in patients with PA treated with MR antagonists compared with patients with essential hypertension. Methods Data Source and Study Cohort The study cohort was derived from a research registry of patients at the Brigham and Women\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital, the Massachusetts General Hospital, and their affiliated partner hospitals (Figure 1). Eligibility for the current study required that patients had to be seen between the years 1991\xe2\x80\x932016 and be \xe2\x89\xa5 18 years of age. Entry into the study was defined as the date immediately after the first follow-up visit: 1\xe2\x80\x936 months after initiating an MR antagonist (for PA patients) or after the diagnosis of essential hypertension was first entered into the medical record (for essential hypertension patients). The registry was searched for all potential patients with PA using International Classification of Disease, 9th and 10th Revisions (ICD-9 and ICD-10) codes as well as using the following text search terms: \xe2\x80\x9cprimary aldosteronism\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cprimary hyperaldosteronism\xe2\x80\x9d, and \xe2\x80\x9cConn\xe2\x80\x99s Syndrome\xe2\x80\x9d. Manual medical record review was performed to exclude patients whose baseline laboratory data were inconsistent with the diagnosis of PA (see Definition of Exposures below). Potential patients with PA were also excluded if they underwent surgical adrenalectomy, had a prior cardiovascular event (see Definition of Outcomes below), were not treated with MR antagonists, or had no follow-up visits after study entry (Figure 1). 602 patients with PA treated longitudinally with MR antagonists were included in the analyses. The registry was then searched for patients with essential hypertension using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes with the search exclusion of the diagnosis of PA. Essential hypertension patients were excluded if they had a prior cardiovascular event, were treated with MR antagonists on or before the date of study entry, or had no follow-up visits after study entry. The essential hypertension population was frequency matched by decade of age at study entry to the PA study population. There were 41853 patients with essential hypertension included in the analyses (Figure 1). Patient cohort data were extracted from our institutional registry and collated into a de-identified database for this study. This approach and research design was approved by the authors\xe2\x80\x99 institutional human research and ethics committees. Definition of Exposure The main exposure was the diagnosis of PA treated with an MR antagonist. The primary comparison group was patients diagnosed with essential hypertension who were frequency matched by age (see Supplementary Appendix for detailed information on exposure definitions). Exposures for secondary analyses included plasma renin activity (PRA) while on MR antagonist therapy and pre-treatment serum aldosterone levels in the PA cohort. We categorized PA patients who had at least one PRA measured more than one month after starting MR antagonists by whether the first PRA measurement on MR antagonist therapy was unsuppressed (\xe2\x89\xa5 1\xc2\xb70 \xc2\xb5g/L/h) or remained suppressed (< 1\xc2\xb70 \xc2\xb5g/L/h). For this secondary analysis, entry into the study for PA patients treated with MR antagonists was defined as the date of the first PRA measurement. We also categorized PA patients by a pre-treatment serum aldosterone concentration (defined as the most recent value prior to starting MR antagonist therapy) that was high (\xe2\x89\xa5 555 pmol/L) or low (< 555 pmol/L). Definition of Covariates The following covariates at the time of study entry were considered as potential confounders: age, sex, race, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, history of diabetes mellitus, hemoglobin A1C, history of atrial fibrillation, LDL cholesterol, statin use, estimated glomerular filtration rate, daily aspirin use, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and number of antihypertensive medications prescribed (excluding MR antagonists). Definition of Outcomes The primary outcome was an incident cardiovascular event defined as a composite of incident myocardial infarction (MI) or coronary revascularization, congestive heart failure (CHF) hospitalization, or stroke (see detailed information on outcome assessments in the Supplementary Appendix). Secondary outcomes were the individual components of the composite cardiovascular outcome, as well as incident atrial fibrillation, incident diabetes mellitus, and death. Statistical Analysis The primary analysis investigated whether patients with PA treated with an MR antagonist had a higher risk of incident composite cardiovascular events compared with patients with essential hypertension. Secondary analyses investigated the risk of the individual components of the composite cardiovascular outcome, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and death between these two populations, and whether PRA or aldosterone measurements in the PA group influenced this risk. We used multivariate Cox regression models (proc PHREG in SAS v9\xc2\xb74, Cary, NC) to estimate adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. All models were adjusted for the aforementioned covariates at the time of study entry. The analyses for incident atrial fibrillation and diabetes mellitus excluded any patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of the condition at study entry. The proportional hazard assumption was evaluated by testing significance of the exposure-time interactions in the Cox models. The standardized cumulative incidence of composite cardiovascular events was one minus a standardized survival function (proc PHREG baseline statement in SAS v9\xc2\xb74), which was estimated by averaging the estimated individual-specific survival curves based on the multivariate Cox models mentioned above over the distributions of the aforementioned covariates in our cohort. We used this model to calculate differences in standardized cumulative incidence of cardiovascular events at 3, 5, and 10 years of follow-up between patients with PA and patients with essential hypertension. Patients were censored on the date of the specified outcome occurrence or, if they did not develop the outcome during follow-up at our institutions, at the date of their final recorded follow-up visit. The cardiovascular outcomes of incident MI/coronary revascularization, CHF hospitalization, and stroke were treated as competing events and analyzed based on the cause-specific Cox regression models. All p-values are two-sided. Exploratory Analysis In an exploratory analysis which included the initially excluded 205 patients with PA who underwent surgical adrenalectomy and did not have a prior cardiovascular event (Figure S1), we investigated the risk for incident composite cardiovascular events comparing PA treated with surgical adrenalectomy, PA treated with MR antagonist therapy, and essential hypertension. Role of the Funding Source The funding sources for this study had no role in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the manuscript. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. Results Patient Characteristics PA patients treated with MR antagonists were more likely to be male, black, and have lower serum potassium, compared with patients with essential hypertension (Table 1). Age and other cardiovascular risk factors were similar between the two groups. Prior to study entry, PA patients had higher blood pressures compared with patients with essential hypertension; however, at the time of study entry, and throughout the duration of the study, mean blood pressures were comparable (Table S1). Similarly, the mean number of prescribed antihypertensive medications, not including MR antagonists, was also comparable. The majority of PA patients were treated with spironolactone and had bilateral disease (Table 1). Risk for Incident Cardiometabolic Outcomes and Mortality PA patients treated with MR antagonists had a nearly two-fold higher unadjusted incidence rate of composite cardiovascular events (56\xc2\xb73 [95% CI 48\xc2\xb78, 64\xc2\xb77] vs. 26\xc2\xb76 [95% CI 26\xc2\xb71, 27\xc2\xb72] per 1,000 person years) (Table 2). The adjusted hazard ratio for incident composite cardiovascular events was 1\xc2\xb791 (95% CI 1\xc2\xb763, 2\xc2\xb725) (Figure 2), with each individual component of the composite being associated with higher risk (Table 2). Patients with PA also had a significantly higher risk of death and for developing incident atrial fibrillation and diabetes compared with patients with essential hypertension (Table 2). The adjusted 10-year cumulative incidence difference for developing cardiovascular events indicated that PA patients treated with MR antagonists had 14\xc2\xb71 (95% CI 10\xc2\xb71, 18\xc2\xb70) excess events per 100 individuals compared with essential hypertension, and these findings did not materially change when analyses included death as a competing risk (Table 3). Renin Activity as a Biomarker of MR Antagonist Treatment Efficacy Of the 602 PA patients in the study, 201 had their first PRA measured at least one month after initiation of MR antagonist therapy and did not have cardiovascular events. Among these patients, 67 achieved an unsuppressed PRA (\xe2\x89\xa5 1 \xc2\xb5g/L/h); the PRA of the remaining 134 patients remained suppressed (< 1 \xc2\xb5g/L/h) (Figure 3). The median time to the first PRA measurement was similar in those with suppressed (0\xc2\xb756 years [IQR 0\xc2\xb721, 2\xc2\xb708 years]) and unsuppressed PRA measurements (0\xc2\xb762 years [IQR 0\xc2\xb721, 2\xc2\xb758 years]). Compared with patients with essential hypertension, PA patients whose PRA remained suppressed (<1 \xc2\xb5g/L/h) while on MR antagonists had a nearly three-fold higher risk for incident composite cardiovascular events (adjusted HR=2\xc2\xb783 [95% CI 2\xc2\xb711, 3\xc2\xb780]) (Figure 3) and a significantly higher risk for death (adjusted HR=1\xc2\xb779 [95% CI 1\xc2\xb714, 2\xc2\xb780]) (Figure S2). In contrast, achieving an unsuppressed PRA (\xe2\x89\xa51 \xc2\xb5g/L/h) resulted in no statistically significant difference in incident cardiovascular events (Figure 3) or death (Figure S2) compared with patients with essential hypertension. Repeating these analyses based on the second and third PRA measurements did not materially change the results (Table S2). Importantly, the mean longitudinal blood pressures of patients with suppressed and unsuppressed renin were comparable throughout the study period (Table S3); however, patients who had an unsuppressed renin activity were started on higher doses of MR antagonists (initial dose: spironolactone 50 [27] vs 43 [28] mg, eplerenone 65 [27] vs. 53 [48] mg) (Table S4). In contrast, stratified analyses of PA patients by serum aldosterone level at the time of PA diagnosis (prior to initiation of MR antagonist therapy) showed no significant difference in the risk for incident composite cardiovascular events between PA patients with high vs. low pre-treatment serum aldosterone levels (Figure S3). Exploratory Analysis: Medical versus Surgical Therapy for PA and Incident Outcomes Surgically treated patients were younger and had biochemically more severe PA; however, the blood pressure upon entry into the analysis was comparable across sub-groups (Table S5). Patients with surgically treated PA had a significantly lower risk for incident composite cardiovascular events compared with those with essential hypertension (adjusted HR = 0\xc2\xb758 [95% CI 0\xc2\xb735, 0\xc2\xb797]) (Figure S4). Discussion The current study demonstrates that even when patients with PA are treated with MR antagonists to achieve similar blood pressures as patients with essential hypertension with comparable cardiovascular risk profiles, they had an approximately two-fold higher risk for incident cardiovascular outcomes, as well as higher risks for incident diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and death. Importantly, this higher risk appeared to be limited to PA patients whose renin remained suppressed on MR antagonist therapy; in contrast, the risk in PA patients who were treated with higher doses of MR antagonists and had a substantial rise in renin was not different from patients with essential hypertension. Since the suppression of renin in PA is a result of excessive MR activation and volume expansion, the rise in renin with MR antagonist therapy reflects sufficient antagonism of the renal-MR (and potentially extra-renal MR). Together, the current study suggests an alarming clinical practice of insufficient MR blockade and excessive cardiometabolic risk in medically treated PA patients, and raises the distinct possibility that a novel practice recommendation may improve outcomes in patients with PA: in addition to blood pressure lowering, titration of MR antagonists to target a rise in renin may be the most effective indicator of adequate MR antagonism that corresponds to cardiovascular risk reduction and survival that is comparable to patients with essential hypertension and approaching that of surgically treated patients with PA. Since PA was first described by Jerome Conn, it has been observed that when possible, surgical therapy to eliminate the source of aldosterone excess remarkably improves blood pressure and risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. In contrast, since most studies assessing the efficacy of MR antagonist therapy have been either cross-sectional or longitudinal and small in size, the general recommendation to use MR antagonists by professional society guidelines has been based on the assumption that this approach may be as effective as medical therapy for essential hypertension. For example, perhaps the two most influential studies in this regard are those by Catena et al. and Reincke et al.. Catena et al. conducted a longitudinal analysis investigating the risk for incident cardiovascular events (similar composite outcome to our current study) in 54 patients with PA treated with a mixture of surgical or MR antagonist therapy compared with 323 patients with essential hypertension. Although they observed a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease in PA patients at baseline, there were only 10 incident events in the PA population and 19 incident events in the essential hypertension population, resulting in no significant difference in incident outcomes, and no observable differences in outcomes between medically and surgically treated PA patients. Reincke et al. investigated long-term mortality in a longitudinal cohort study comparing PA patients treated with a mixture of surgery or MR antagonists with essential hypertension and found that patients with PA had no difference in all-cause mortality (22 deaths) compared with essential hypertension (74 deaths); however, in secondary analyses cardiovascular mortality was higher in PA patients (50% vs. 34% of deaths). Our current findings substantially extend those of others before us. The lack of large and robust longitudinal data assessing the effectiveness of MR antagonists in PA has resulted in the absence of specific recommendations outlining the optimal approach to medical therapy in PA: should MR antagonists be titrated to normalize blood pressure, normalize potassium, raise renin, or target a different factor? As our findings show, although physicians at well-regarded and large academic centers routinely prescribed MR antagonists for PA, and achieved blood pressure control to a similar degree as comparable patients with essential hypertension, their approach was associated with a substantially higher risk for cardiometabolic outcomes and death compared with essential hypertension and surgically cured PA. In this regard, our study suggests that it may not be appropriate to assume that surgical and medical treatments for PA, or that blood pressure control for PA and essential hypertension, are similarly effective and the need to discuss these options more candidly with patients. Further, the size and scope of our study design permitted analyses that indicated that focusing only on controlling blood pressure with MR antagonists may be insufficient to reduce long-term cardiometabolic risk in PA. Activation of the renal and extra-renal MR by aldosterone is associated with not only hypertension, but also myocardial fibrosis, left ventricular hypertrophy, nephropathy, and death; therefore, a strategy that targets more aggressive dosing of MR antagonists and uses a rise in renin as a crude physiologic biomarker to assess sufficient blockade of the renal-MR may be the most effective way to reduce cardiovascular risk in medically treated PA. It should be noted that the risk for incident cardiovascular events we observed among patients with moderate-to-severe essential hypertension (on average using 3 antihypertensive medications) was remarkably similar to that previously reported in comparable cohorts of essential hypertension. Thus, it is alarming that despite having similar blood pressures at baseline and throughout longitudinal follow-up while on MR antagonists, our cohort of PA patients had 14\xc2\xb71 more cardiovascular events per 100 persons at 10 years of follow-up when compared with essential hypertension. In addition, PA patients treated with MR antagonists also had a significantly higher risk for incident atrial fibrillation and diabetes, conditions that have previously been suspected to be due to aldosterone excess. Our results must be interpreted within the context of the study design. First, this study was observational. Although blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors were similar at the time of study entry and our models adjusted for important confounders, there may still be residual confounding and misclassification. Since our study used an open cohort design, we could not capture nonfatal cardiovascular events that occurred outside of our healthcare system which may have resulted in an underestimation of cumulative incidence rates. Second, only a subset of study participants had renin measured in follow-up, the timing and frequency of renin measurements were variable, and it was unclear if and when any of the renin values were used to guide therapy. Further, although our data suggest that higher MR antagonist dosing may be required to achieve a rise in renin, the heterogeneity in the type and dosing of MR antagonists limit generalizeability. Thus, we cannot firmly conclude that the intent-to-treat to a rise in renin is beneficial, nor can we affirm what level of renin activity best reflects sufficient MR antagonism to reduce cardiovascular risk. Third, our observational study design did not prospectively control blood pressure in each exposure group. Although patients with PA had higher blood pressures prior to study entry, upon initiation of therapy at study entry, blood pressure control and use of antihypertensive medications were comparable to those with essential hypertension, the longitudinal control of blood pressure was comparable, and our models adjusted for the treated blood pressure at study entry. Fourth, although our models adjusted for number of antihypertensive medications, we did not have sufficient information to adjust for all longitudinal changes in daily doses and frequencies of antihypertensive medications; however, repeating our analyses with adjustments for individual antihypertensive medication subclasses did not appreciably change the results. Fifth, we could not adequately account for the duration and degree of antecedent hypertension. However, our findings suggest that even if antecedent hypertension was a risk factor, treatment to modulate renin activity may mitigate its effect. Sixth, although our sample sizes precluded us from conducting further subset analyses, future studies should investigate whether our findings apply similarly to unilateral and bilateral forms of PA. Finally, PA patients in our study did not undergo systematic assessments for subclinical hypercortisolism since this is not a routinely recommend practice in PA. Although cortisol co-secretion in PA and by adrenal tumors may contribute to cardiometabolic disease, cortisol is a mineralocorticoid and a glucocorticoid, thus MR antagonists should abrogate most of the cardiovascular consequences related to cortisol. In conclusion, PA is characterized by renin-independent aldosterone secretion that results in excessive MR activation and cardiovascular disease. When possible, surgical adrenalectomy to cure the aldosterone excess in PA mitigates this excess risk; however, the majority of patients with PA are treated medically with MR antagonists that are presumed to be an effective alternative to surgery. The current study demonstrates that the current clinical practice of using MR antagonists for PA may fail to abrogate the excess risk for cardiometabolic outcomes (primary outcome) as well as death, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes (secondary outcomes) compared with similar patients with essential hypertension and, therefore, a more aggressive and multi-faceted approach to medical therapy may be needed. Targeting a rise in renin as a biomarker for adequate MR blockade may serve as an important clinical benchmark for providers who treat PA patients with MR antagonists.

Research in Context Evidence before this study Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common modifiable form of hypertension and substantially increases the risk for cardiometabolic disease and death. The vast majority of patients with PA are treated medically with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) rather than adrenalectomy. Although international societies and expert committees strongly recommend this use of MRAs as the main medical therapy for PA, there are no large longitudinal or intervention studies demonstrating the efficacy of MR antagonists for reducing the risk for cardiovascular or metabolic diseases in PA, nor any specific guidelines regarding optimal treatment targets when prescribing MR antagonists for PA. We considered evidence assessing the efficacy of MRAs in PA using The Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines on the management of PA and citations within it, and we searched for articles using a PubMed query for: primary aldosteronism, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, cardiovascular events, and renin. Added value of this study The current study is the largest longitudinal study to assess whether the current use of MRAs in PA is effective at lowering the risk for incident cardiometabolic disease and death. The findings of this study show that when compared with patients with essential hypertension who had comparable demographic profiles and longitudinal blood pressure trends, patients with PA treated with MRAs had significantly higher risks for incident cardiovascular events, death, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. The large sample size of this study permitted robust statistical significance and the ability to assess that the risks for these events were independent of blood pressure, thereby implicating the independent and deleterious effects of aldosterone excess and mineralocorticoid receptor activation. Further, this study demonstrated that patients with PA who were treated with higher doses of MRAs, such that their renin activity substantially increased, had decreased risk for cardiovascular events and death such that the risk for these outcomes was no different than that of patients with essential hypertension. Implications of all the available evidence The current use of MRAs for the medical treatment of PA is associated with significantly higher risk for incident cardiometabolic events and death, and these risks are independent of blood pressure control. Titrating MRA doses to raise renin activity may represent the most effective approach to mitigate this excess risk. Clinical practice guidelines for PA should consider recommending that blood pressure control with MRA therapy alone may be insufficient at mitigating excess cardiovascular risk; rather, targeting a rise in renin activity as a clinical benchmark for adequate mineralocorticoid receptor blockade may be the most efficient therapeutic approach."

Abstract
Increased risk of atrial fibrillation was reported in patients with primary aldosteronism. However, data are limited regarding the time-dependent risk of atrial fibrillation in surgically or medically treated primary aldosteronism. From the National Health Insurance Claim database in Korea (2003â2017), a total of 1418 patients with primary aldosteronism (adrenalectomy [ADX], n=755, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist n=663) were age- and sex-matched at a 1:5 ratios to patients with essential hypertension (n=7090). Crude incidence of new onset atrial fibrillation was 2.96% in primary aldosteronism and 1.97% in essential hypertension. Because of nonproportional hazard observed in new onset atrial fibrillation, analysis time was split at 3 years. Compared with essential hypertension, risk of new onset atrial fibrillation peaked at 1 year gradually declined but remained elevated up to 3 years in overall treated primary aldosteronism (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 3.02; P<0.001) as well as in both ADX (aHR, 3.54; P<0.001) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist groups (aHR 2.27; P=0.031), which became comparable to essential hypertension afterward in both groups (ADX aHR, 0.38; P=0.102; mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist aHR, 0.60; P=0.214). Nonetheless, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist group was associated with increased risk of nonfatal stroke (aHR, 1.21; P=0.031) compared with essential hypertension, whereas ADX was not (aHR, 1.26; P=0.288). Our results suggest the risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation remained elevated up to 3 years in treated primary aldosteronism compared with essential hypertension, which declined to comparable risk in essential hypertension thereafter. Monitoring for atrial fibrillation up to 3 years after treatment, particularly ADX, might be warranted.
Introduction
Primary aldosteronism (PA), characterized by excessive autonomous aldosterone production independent of renin, is the most frequent cause of secondary hypertension.1 Recent studies have estimated that the prevalence of PA ranges from 5% to 15% in hypertensive patients, with even higher prevalence (17%â23%) in patients with resistant hypertension.2â5 Aldosterone excess can promote organ damage via the dysregulation of blood volume and electrolyte, as well as through pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and vascular inflammation.6â8 Patients with PA were reported to have higher risks of cardiovascular events, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, and stroke compared with those with essential hypertension (EH) independent of blood pressure level.9â11
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most commonly observed arrhythmia, and has a prevalence of up to 3% in adults. AF is associated with increased risk of thromboembolic events.12 Notably, the presence of excess aldosterone is associated to profibrotic and proarrhythmogenic effects, which promote AF development.12,13 PA has been associated with high prevalence of AF up to 7.3%.14 In the PAPPHY (Prospective Appraisal on the Prevalence of Primary Aldosteronism in Hypertensive) Study, PA was confirmed in 42% of 183 patients who presented with AF with no known structural cause.15 Based on these findings, recent European Society guidelines emphasized the importance of AF as a sign of PA at presentation.16 Previous studies reported that surgical adrenalectomy (ADX) was associated with lowered risk of new-onset AF (NOAF) in patients with PA compared with EH, whereas NOAF risk remained elevated in mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) treatment group with insufficient MR blockade.17â19 Given the structural changes because of cardiac remodeling by aldosterone excess and the progressive recovery of cardiac parameters after PA treatment, it is conceivable that risk of NOAF may vary in a time-dependent manner post-ADX or -MRA treatment in patients with PA.13,20,21 However, data are limited about time-dependent risk of NOAF after ADX or MRA treatment in PA.
In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the risk of NOAF in patients with PA who underwent surgical or medical treatment was elevated compared with patients with EH independent of conventional risk factors, and whether the risk of NOAF in patients with treated PA was time dependent or not.
Methods
Data Source
We used a nationwide cohort database provided by the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS), which includes 51.5 million inhabitants (â97% of entire population of South Korea).22 To facilitate reimbursements, all medical institutions submit health care utilizationârelated information, which is then stored in the NHIS database. This database contains medical and pharmaceutical claim records, disease diagnosis codes (International Classification of Diseases, TenthRevision [ICD-10]), medical procedure and hospital admission information, prescribed drugs, health examination data such as anthropometric measures, and death records. The data used for this study comprised NHIS claim records between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2017. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Wonju Severance Christian Hospital (IRB number: CR318340). Informed consent was waived because data from the NHIS cohort do not involve any personally identifiable information.
Study Subjects
To identify individuals likely to have PA, we used an algorithm composed of diagnosis codes for primary aldosteronism based on ICD-10 codes and medication/procedure codes, which were validated in multicenter hospitalâbased cohorts (Methods in the Data Supplement). Among various operational definitions, PA was defined as presence of relevant diagnosis codes along with confirmation tests and treatments, which revealed best performance to detect patients with PA in validation study (sensitivity, 68.1%; positive predictive value, 90.0%; area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve, 0.81). To apply the algorithm to NHIS cohort, we selected patients with PA, who had ICD-10diagnostic codes indicating a primary or secondary diagnosis of E26 (hyperaldosteronism), I15.20 (hyperaldosteronism from adrenal adenoma), or I15.21 (hyperaldosteronism from bilateral adrenal hyperplasia) more than twice between January of 2003 and December of 2017. Patients aged younger than 18 years and had an ICD-10 diagnostic code of E26.1 (secondary hyperaldosteronism) at least once were excluded. We also excluded patients who did not undergo a diagnostic procedure (saline infusion test or the captopril challenge test) or any appropriate treatment (adrenalectomy or prescription of MRA for >6 months). To detect new onset cardiovascular events, patients with any previous diagnoses of cardiovascular disease including AF, stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure within 1 year before study entry time point were excluded. Patients with PA were subdivided into 2 groups based on the treatment strategy for PA that they received, as follows: (1) those who underwent ADX (ADX group) and (2) those who were prescribed MRA for >6 months without undergoing any ADX during follow-up (MRA group). As a control, patients with EH were defined as ICD-10 any diagnostic code for I10 at least twice a year with antihypertensive drug fills for >180 days (Table S1 in the Data Supplement).23 After excluding those with any prior diagnoses of cardiovascular events as listed above among EH group, patients with PA were matched with EH controls (1:5 ratio) based on index year, age group and sex.
Study End Points
The primary outcome was NOAF, ascertained by 1 inpatient or 2 outpatient records of ICD-10 code I48, which was well validated in several studies based on NHIS cohort.24 Secondary outcomes assessed were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and hospitalization because of heart failure (Table S1).25 Information about deceased individuals were ascertained via death certificate information, which included primary cause of death. Each patient was followed up after the index date (date of claim for ADX or MRA) until the earliest occurrence of any study outcomes, all-cause death, or the end of the observational period (December 31, 2017).
Covariates
Selected comorbidities included this study were obtained from inpatient and outpatient hospital diagnoses (all available primary and secondary diagnoses). Comorbidities (diabetes, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease) were defined based on the presence of ICD-10 diagnostic codes entered for medical claims and prescription medication use (prescribed >30 accumulative days) before the index year (Table S1). Economic status was categorized into 3 groups (lowest 30%, middle 40%, and highest 30%) and were based on the total amount of national health insurance premiums paid by insured individuals.
Statistical Analyses
Baseline characteristics consisting of continuous variables were presented as a meanÂ±SD, and categorical variables were presented as a number (%). Independent t test and _2 analyses were used to compare clinical characteristics of PA and EH groups, respectively. The cumulative incidences of outcomes were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and the log-rank test was used to compare differences among groups. Proportionality of hazards was investigated using time-covariate interactions and plots of Schoenfeld residuals over time. Where hazards were not proportional, data were partitioned into multiple mutually exclusive intervals, and separate Cox models were built for each interval. Cut points were determined using plots of Schoenfeld residuals over time.26,27 Among primary and secondary outcomes, only the model for NOAF failed to meet the proportional hazard assumption, as confirmed based on the Schonfeld P value of â¤0.05. Therefore, we split the study period into 2 periods until the Schonfeld P value became higher than 0.05. Proportionality of hazards testing for NOAF was performed within each interval. In addition, a natural cubic spline model was used to visualize time-dependent trends affecting the risk of NOAF.28 Based on results from Schoenfeld testing and visual inspection of the cubic spline model for risk of NOAF after treatment of PA (Figure S1), we decided to split time interval into 3 years to build time-dependent Cox model. Sensitivity analyses with 1- and 2-year time points were performed to test the robustness of findings. We did not observe any violation in the proportional hazard assumption with regard to secondary clinical outcomes including nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death. This enabled us to apply Cox proportional hazard models without any time-point splitting. We conducted sensitivity analyses to minimize the possibility of reverse causality by excluding individuals who developed AF within 90 days after the index date. We used SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and R version 4.0.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) for data analysis. A 2-sided P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Study Population and Baseline Characteristics
A total of 1418 patients with PA were analyzed in this study in comparison with age-, sex-, and index year-matched EH controls (at a 1:5 ratio; n=7090; Figure 1). Mean age (51.3 versus 49.0 years, P=0.639) and proportion of women included (53.7% versus 53.6%, P=0.999) did not differ between PA and EH groups (Table 1). Index year of study entry was distributed equally among groups (Table S2). Compared with EH, patients with PA were more likely to have chronic kidney disease (9.7 versus 3.3%, P<0.001) and use more _ blockers (35.1% versus 26.0%), calcium channel blockers (76.3% versus 58.6%), and diuretics (71.2% versus 22.1%, P<0.001 for all comparisons). Among subgroups of PA, the MRA group was older (51.3 versus 46.7 years, P<0.001), contained a higher proportion of men (50.7% versus 42.5%, P=0.001), and had a higher prevalence of comorbidities and antihypertensive medication usage compared with the ADX group.

In this study, we excluded patients with any history of cardiovascular disease including atrial fibrillation, stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure before the index year. ADX indicates adrenalectomy; CCT, captopril challenge test; CVD, cardiovascular disease; EH, essential hypertension; HTN, hypertension; MRA, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist; PA, primary aldosteronism; and SIT, saline infusion test.
Time-Dependent Risk of NOAF in Patients With PA After Treatment Initiation
During the median 5 years of follow-up (interquartile range: 2.6â8.7 years), the overall crude incidence of NOAF was 2.96% and 1.97% in PA and EH groups, respectively (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.33; P=0.155; Table 2). When the follow-up duration was limited to 3 years, the risk of NOAF remained higher in PA than EH groups throughout the 3-year period that followed all treatments (adjusted HR, 3.02 [95% CI, 1.76â5.18], P<0.001). Thereafter, the risk of NOAF in patients with PA was similar to that of patients with EH (adjusted HR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.25â1.01], P=0.053). The risk of NOAF after initiation of treatment for PA showed gradual decline in natural cubic spline curve within 3 years but remained elevated in both ADX (adjusted HR, 3.54, P<0.001) and MRA groups (adjusted HR, 2.27, P=0.031; Figure 2), followed by restoration of the NOAF risk to comparable level to that of EH after 3 years (ADX, adjusted HR, 0.38, P=0.102; MRA, adjusted HR, 0.60, P=0.214; Figure 2). Sensitivity analyses that assessed different time point split (1 and 2 yearsâ post-treatment) revealed similar findings in which a gradual decline of NOAF risk between 1 and 3 years post-treatment was observed (at the 1-, 2-, and 3-year time point; total PA: adjusted HR, 4.67, 3.46, and 3.02; ADX group: adjusted HR, 4.76, 3.75, and 3.54; MRA group: and adjusted HR, 3.17, 2.49, and 2.27, respectively; P<0.05 for all comparisons; Table S3). Moreover, further washout for NOAF events which occurred within 90 days after index date to exclude potential reverse causality did not alter the findings observed on total PA and ADX group, whereas the risk of NOAF was statistically attenuated in MRA group within 3 years (adjusted HR, 1.42 [95% CI, 0.54â3.76], P=0.483; Table S4). A similar gradual decline of NOAF risk in ADX and MRA groups, which reached comparable level to that of the EH group after about 3 years, was also observed in a natural cubic spline curve after excluding NOAF events that occurred within 90 days of the index date (Figure S1).

Natural cubic spline curves of the hazard ratio of new onset atrial fibrillation between patients with treated primary aldosteronism in the adrenalectomy (ADX) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) groups vs matched essential hypertension (EH) group controls. Time-dependent risk curves of incident NOAF of the 2 groups (ADX and MRA groups) were compared with matched EH controls. Changes in risk over time resulted in gradual risk decline and seemed to be prominent when time points before and after the third-year as a cut point.
Risk of Incident Cardiovascular Events in Patients With PA After Treatment Initiation
During the follow-up period, the risk of incident nonfatal stroke was elevated in patients with PA compared with those with EH (Table 3; crude incidence 4.72% versus 3.46%, respectively; unadjusted HR, 1.39, P=0.016). The value remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, income, comorbidities, and medication use (adjusted HR, 1.40, P=0.034; Figure S2). Among treatment subgroups, the MRA group was at an increased risk for nonfatal stroke compared with the EH group (adjusted HR, 1.53 [95% CI, 1.04â2.26], P=0.031), whereas the ADX group was not (adjusted HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 0.82â1.92], P=0.288). The MRA group had increased risks of all-cause mortality (unadjusted HR, 1.98; P<0.001) and hospitalization due to heart failure (unadjusted HR, 1.88; P=0.001), although the association was not significant after adjustment for covariates in multivariable Cox models (all-cause mortality: adjusted HR, 0.99; P=0.965; hospitalization due to heart failure: adjusted HR, 1.27; P=0.257).
Risk of Incident Cardiovascular Events in PA and EH From the Time of Hypertension Diagnosis
In Table S5, the risk of incident cardiovascular events from the time of hypertension diagnosis was compared between PA and EH groups, without excluding events before PA treatment initiation. The risk of NOAF (adjusted HR, 1.76; P=0.006), nonfatal stroke (adjusted HR, 2.60; P<0.001), nonfatal myocardial infarction (adjusted HR, 2.15; P<0.001), and hospitalization for heart failure (adjusted HR, 1.80; P<0.001) from the time of hypertension diagnosis was higher in patients with PA compared with matched EH, with higher risk in MRA than in ADX group in patients with PA (Table S5).
Discussion
In this study, we observed that individuals treated for PA had a higher risk of NOAF compared with those with EH. Further, time-dependent increases in NOAF risk throughout the first 3 years of following treatment initiation in both ADX and MRA groups were observed compared with the EH group. The risk peaked within the first year after the treatment for PA and gradually declined to a level that was comparable to that of the EH group over a period of 3 years, then was stabilized. Nonetheless, the MRA group had about 1.5-fold higher risk of nonfatal stroke compared with the EH group, which was independent of covariates, whereas the risk of stroke in patients treated with surgical ADX did not differ significantly from that of EH patients during follow-up.
In previous studies, patients with PA were shown to have higher risk of prevalent or incident AF compared with those with EH.11,14,29 Milliez et al14 reported a 12.1-fold higher odds of AF development in patients with PA compared with EH, which corresponded to an overall prevalence of 7.3%. A meta-analysis of 31 studies by Monticone et al9 also revealed a 3.5-fold higher risk of AF in patients with PA compared with EH during a median follow-up period of 8.8 years. In patients provided with PA treatment, the risk of NOAF was known to differ based on treatment modality used. In the longitudinal follow-up to the PAPY (Primary Aldosteronism Prevalence in Hypertension) Study, patients with PA who were treated with surgical ADX had similar NOAF risk compared with those with optimally treated EH.17 Similarly, in a retrospective cohort of patients with PA, patients with PA treated with ADX did not have a statistically different risk of NOAF (adjusted HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.41â1.36]) when compared with matched EH controls during 10-year follow-up period.18 In line with these findings, we observed that patients with PA treated with ADX had no statistically different risk of NOAF compared with the EH group throughout long-term follow-up. However, risk of NOAF in the ADX group was time-dependent, residual risk of NOAF persisted for as long as the first 3 years after the initiation of PA treatment, at which point it gradually declined to a level comparable to that of EH. In a large retrospective study involving 2202 patients with PA, which used claim database records from Taiwan, surgical ADX significantly reduced risk of NOAF compared with EH.19 Further, we determined a similar hazard ratio point estimate of 0.50, which indicate a protective effect against NOAF after 3 years of ADX treatment; however, the value was not statistically significant (95% CI, 0.25â1.01). This could be at least partly attributed to the smaller sample size of our study compared with that which was previously published. Whether longer term follow-up or a larger sample size will reveal low NOAF risk in the ADX group compared with EH after 3 years of follow-up remains unclear.
We observed similar results in MRA group that the risk of NOAF remained elevated up to 3 years in PA group after initiation of MRA treatment when compared with EH, with smaller magnitude of NOAF risk compared with ADX group within the first 3 years. After 3 years, risk of NOAF in MRA group was comparable to that of the EH group. In prior studies, patients with PA that received MRA had increased risk of NOAF, compared with those with EH.17,19 Of note, the MRA-treated patients with increased renin activity and sufficient MR blockade did not have a statistically significant difference in the NOAF risk compared with patients of the EH group, whereas elevated NOAF risk was observed in MRA-treated patients with suppressed renin activity and insufficient MR blockade during the 10-year follow-up.18Given that the minimum criteria for MRA group in our study was MRA treatment for at least 6 months or more based on operational definition, it is conceivable that the MRA-treated patients in our study were patients with relatively high compliance. Considering the relatively short follow-up duration (median=5 years) of our study, a longer observation period might lead to significant differences between MRA and EH, which require further validation.
Although the risk of NOAF was elevated throughout the first 3 years after treatment for PA, the magnitude of residual risk was higher in the ADX group than the MRA group, and a steeper decline of risk in the ADX was observed. When NOAF events occurred within the 90 days after the index date were excluded, residual increased risk within 3 years in MRA group lost statistical significance, whereas the risk in ADX remained significantly higher in this study. Considering the relatively high aldosterone level and elevated prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities observed in the aldosterone-producing adenoma subtype compared with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, these findings suggest that the magnitude of short-term residual risk after the initiation of PA treatment might be proportional to the severity of aldosterone excess.30 Aldosterone excess is known to contribute directly or indirectly to the pathophysiology of AF occurrence.12,19 Atrial structural remodeling and atrial electrical remodeling are 2 possible direct effects of aldosterone on AF.12 Cardiac fibrosis in the left ventricle and atrium with increased inflammation promote cardiac structural remodeling, which increases susceptibility to AF.31 The association between atrial electrical remodeling and AF can be explained by aldosterone-induced atrial fibrosis, intracellular calcium overload, increased mineralocorticoid receptor expression, and enhanced reentry enhancement due to the shortening of action potential.12 Chronic manifestations such as arterial hypertension and electrolyte imbalance produced by excess aldosterone could be indirectly attributed to the development of AF.19 As such, echocardiographic studies have shown that blockade of aldosterone excess can restore left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and aldosterone-induced structural remodeling via the recovery of left ventricular hypertrophy.21 The time needed to improve structural defects induced by aldosterone varied considerably between studies, and ranged from 1 year to 10 years post-treatment, which might reflect variability with respect to disease duration and aldosterone excess severity.20,32,33 Lin and colleagues reported that vascular stiffness was significantly improved, but remained high compared with EH, after 1 year of-ADX treatment, suggesting the potential for latent recovery of the cardiovascular system even with the complete removal of the source of aldosterone excess.34Taken together, our findings suggest a clinical point to which routine monitoring for NOAF may be needed, which extends at least 3-years post-initiation of PA treatment. This is predicted to be particularly important for patients who undergo ADX, but findings presented here require further validation.
In this study, the risk of nonfatal stroke was significantly higher in PA patients in the MRA group compared with EH group, whereas the risk of nonfatal stroke did not differ significantly between ADX and EH groups. Our findings align well with those of previous studies, which demonstrated the increased risk of cerebrovascular accidents in PA patients treated with MRA.19,35 AF is associated with a 3- to 5-fold higher risk for developing stroke as a well-known predisposing factor.33 However, in our data, nonfatal stroke risk was significantly increased in the MRA group versus the EH group, despite the fact that NOAF risk was alleviated after 3 years when reviewing data with a median follow-up period of 5 years. This finding indicates that the elevation of nonfatal stroke risk may not be fully explained by AF alone in MRA group. Aldosterone excess is known to directly induce cerebral ischemia via increased oxidative stress, vessel wall fibrosis, and excessive dilatation of the cerebral vessels.4 Similar to cardiac remodeling observed in the pathogenesis of AF, aldosterone is responsible for increased arterial wall stiffness.36 In line with these findings, excess risk of other various cardiovascular events and mortality was also observed in patients who were treated with MRA versus EH patients, independent of blood pressure control.35 Our findings and those of prior studies suggest that current MRA treatments in patients with PA may not be sufficient to prevent cardiovascular accidents including nonfatal stroke. As a result, further investigation to facilitate the development of a strategy to optimize MRA therapy in patients with PA is needed.
In this study, we analyzed the residual risk of cardiovascular events after initiation of medical or surgical treatment in patients with PA, which showed no significant difference between PA and EH in all events except nonfatal stroke. However, when we extended the analysis with the comparison of cardiovascular risk from the time of hypertension diagnosis, patients with PA had significantly higher risk of NOAF, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and hospitalization for heart failure compared with EH, in line with prior meta-analysis of median 8.8 years follow-up from the diagnosis of hypertension.9 These findings indicate that the cardiovascular risk measured in this study was not the peak but the residual risk after treatment initiation for PA, which need to be distinguished from overall risk from the time of diagnosis of hypertension considering that PA is often diagnosed late.
This study has several limitations. It was based on secondary analyses of claim database, which lacked information about individual level clinical characteristics such as blood pressure, serum potassium level, aldosterone level, renin activity, and echocardiography data as well as potential diagnoses error and medication compliance rate.37 Due to the retrospective, observational study design, residual confounding cannot be ruled out, although we tried to adjust covariates including comorbidities and medication use as well as possible. Although we detected individuals who were likely to have PA using an operational definition, due to inherent structural limitation of the claim database, we used validated definition based on a multicenter hospital-based cohort, which showed good performance and a high positive predictive value. To detect new-onset cardiovascular outcomes using the claim database, we inevitably excluded individuals with any cardiovascular diagnoses throughout the year that preceded the index date, which might lead to selection bias since individuals with relatively milder diseases that lacked cardiovascular events were preferentially selected. Therefore, our findings may not be generalizable to patients with PA generally, or to ethnicities other than Koreans. However, despite potential selection bias for milder diseases, we observed significant, time-dependent risk of NOAF in patients treated for PA, which has not been demonstrated previously.
Perspectives
This study revealed that the risk of NOAF remained elevated up to the first 3 years after treatment in patients with PA by both ADX and MRA. NOAF risk peaked in the first year after treatment and gradually declined. However, risk still elevated throughout the first 3-year period after treatment and reached levels comparable to that of the EH group after 3 years. The magnitude of the increased risk was higher in the ADX than MRA group, and a steeper decline was observed after the surgical treatment. Nevertheless, MRA group had increased risk of nonfatal stroke compared with the EH group, while the ADX group did not. Our findings indicate that NOAF monitoring for at least 3-years after PA treatment, particularly for those that undergo ADX, may be warranted."

Abstract
Primary aldosteronism (PA) causes cardiovascular damage in excess to the blood pressure elevation, but there are no prospective studies proving a worse long-term prognosis in adrenalectomized and medically treated patients. We have, therefore, assessed the outcome of PA patients according to treatment mode in the PAPY study (Primary Aldosteronism Prevalence in Hypertension) patients, 88.8% of whom were optimally treated patients with primary (essential) hypertension (PH), and the rest had PA and were assigned to medical therapy (6.4%) or adrenalectomy (4.8%). Total mortality was the primary end point; secondary end points were cardiovascular death, major adverse cardiovascular events, including atrial fibrillation, and total cardiovascular events. KaplanâMeier and Cox analysis were used to compare survival between PA and its subtypes and PH patients. After a median of 11.8 years, complete follow-up data were obtained in 89% of the 1125 patients in the original cohort. Only a trend (P=0.07) toward a worse death-free survival in PA than in PH patients was observed. However, at both univariate (90.0% versus 97.8%; P=0.002) and multivariate analyses (hazard ratio, 1.82; 95% confidence interval, 1.08â3.08; P=0.025), medically treated PA patients showed a lower atrial fibrillationâfree survival than PH patients. By showing that during a long-term follow-up adrenalectomized aldosterone-producing adenoma patients have a similar long-term outcome of optimally treated PH patients, whereas, at variance, medically treated PA patients remain at a higher risk of atrial fibrillation, this large prospective study emphasizes the importance of an early identification of PA patients who need adrenalectomy as a key measure to prevent incident atrial fibrillation.
Introduction
See Editorial Commentary, pp 566â568
Primary aldosteronism (PA), the most common cause of endocrine arterial hypertension, has been associated with a cardiovascular damage,1 including left ventricular hypertrophy,2 fibrosis,3 vascular remodeling,4 arterial stiffening, endothelial dysfunction,5 and microalbuminuria,6 which exceeded that expected by the degree of blood pressure (BP) elevation. Moreover, PA is common in patients with drug-resistant hypertension,7 which implies a more prominent cardiovascular damage and a worse prognosis.8 The detrimental role of aldosterone is also indicated by the finding of left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with aldosteronism and a hyperdynamic circulation even in the lack of elevated BP.9,10 Experimental data also support the view that in the setting of normal- to high-sodium intake, excess aldosterone can damage the left ventricle and the left atrium.11
It was, therefore, suggested that for the same degree of BP elevation, PA would carry a worse outcome than primary hypertension (PH), but this contention stands on retrospective surveys,12â14 the first of which reported a marked increase of relative risk of myocardial infarction (6.5-fold), stroke (4.2-fold), and atrial fibrillation (12.1-fold), in PA compared with PH patients.15 A meta-analysis of few small-sized studies also suggested that target treatment of PA can induce regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, a surrogate for hard cardiovascular outcomes,16 thus further supporting a causal relationship between hyperaldosteronism and cardiovascular risk. Whether the specific treatment delivered to PA patients, for example, medical therapy or adrenalectomy, has a different impact on prognosis remains, however, to be shown in prospective long-term outcome trials.
The PAPY study (Primary Aldosteronism Prevalence in Hypertension) prospectively recruited a sizable cohort of consecutively referred hypertensive patients nationwide in Italy between 2000 and 2005. This study was conceived to establish the high prevalence of PA and its subtypes in referred hypertensive patients17 and to provide long-term follow-up data on the impact of specific treatment of PA on prognosis. Specifically, we wished to determine the cardiovascular event-free survival of medically and surgically treated PA patients, compared with demographically similar optimally treated patients with PH,18 but randomization to either treatment was ethically unacceptable because adrenalectomy was held to be the best available treatment for patients with unilateral PA. Therefore, following available guidelines,19 PA patients were assigned to adrenalectomy or medical treatment based on demonstration of lateralized aldosterone excess. We herein report on the main results of the longitudinal part of the study regarding the effects of specific treatments on long-term prognosis.
Methods
The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.
We prospectively recruited between 2000 and 2005 consecutive hypertensive patients referred nationwide to specialized centers for hypertension. Briefly, they underwent a protocol approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Padua,17 which entailed measurement of the aldosteroneârenin ratio (ARR) at baseline and after captopril challenge after the same predefined work-up. The only exclusion criterion comprised a prior diagnosis of secondary hypertension and patientâs refusal to participate in the study.
Treatment-naive patients were investigated with no antihypertensive drugs; those already treated underwent screening after switching to calcium channel blockers or doxazosin, or a combination of the two agents.19,20 Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (spironolactone, canrenone, or potassium canrenoate) and other agents affecting the reninâangiotensinâaldosterone system (diuretics, _-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists) were withdrawn at least 6 and 2 weeks before, respectively.
The screening test was performed in the sitting position after 1-hour rest and again 60 minutes after 50-mg oral captopril administration. Several variables, including measurement of plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), plasma renin activity (PRA), Na+ and K+ in serum and in 24-hour urine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (by the CKD-EPI [Chronic Kidney DiseaseâEpidemiology Collaboration] equation) were measured. The aldosterone (PAC, in ng/dL):renin (PRA, in ng/mL/h) ratio at baseline and after captopril was calculated.21 Further work-up followed the recommendations available at that time, which basically anticipated those thereafter released by the Endocrine Society.19 Briefly, it comprised a saline infusion test and a high-resolution computed tomographic scan and magnetic resonance imaging, which were performed in all patients with an ARR â¥40 at baseline and â¥30 postcaptopril administration. Subtyping was performed in those fulfilling the aforementioned biochemical criteria, who showed a positive saline infusion test. Adrenal vein sampling was available at one third of the centers, which recruited 67% of the whole cohort. When bilaterally selective, which means with a selectivity index >2.0, it was used for allocating PA patients to adrenalectomy if the lateralization index exceeded a cutoff of 2.0 under unstimulated conditions.22 At centers where adrenal vein sampling was unfeasible, lateralized aldosterone excess production was ascertained by dexamethasone-suppressed adrenocortical 131I-norcholesterol scintigraphy.
After subtyping, PA patients with lateralized aldosterone secretion were adrenalectomized23; those with no evidence for lateralized aldosterone excess were medically treated with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, mostly spironolactone, canrenone, or potassium canrenoate (median daily dose of 50 mg; range, 25â200 mg), plus additional antihypertensive drugs as needed to achieve a BP <140/90 mm_Hg. After the baseline evaluation and diagnosis, the patients were invited for regular follow-up visits at each center, where the attending physicians were instructed to prescribe all antihypertensive medications that were needed to achieve the target BP values of 140/90 mm_Hg defined by the 2003 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines.24
PRA was measured by radioimmunoassay with commercial kits (Ren CTK; Sorin Biomedica, Saluggia, Italy, in 10 centers; or Angiotensin I RIA CT; Radim, Pomezia, Italy, in the others); intra-assay and interassay coefficient of variation was within 8% and 10%, respectively. PAC was measured with a commercial kit (Aldosterone Mirya; Technogenetics, Cassina de Pecchi, Italy; normal range between 1.0â15.0 ng/dL supine and 3.0â32.0 ng/dL upright on a normal Na+diet; intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation <5.6%). For the ARR calculation, PRA values <0.20 ng/mL per hour were fixed at this value to avoid overinflation of the ARR.
Diagnostic Criteria
By protocol, PA was diagnosed if the ARR was â¥40 at baseline and â¥30 postcaptopril administration, and a previously validated logistic discriminant function score was â¥0.50.21,25 The diagnosis of APA was confirmed in all adrenalectomized patients by a centralized Adjudication Committee based on the following (4 corners) criteria: (1) a biochemical diagnosis of PA; (2) lateralization of aldosterone secretion either at adrenal vein sampling or at NP59 dexamethasone-suppressed adrenocortical scintigraphy; (3) adenoma demonstration at pathology assessment; and (4) evidence of normokalemia and cure or improvement of hypertension at follow-up at least 120 days after adrenalectomy. Cure was defined as a BP <140/90 mm_Hg, for systolic and diastolic, respectively, without antihypertensive medications; improvement was defined as systolic and diastolic BP <140/90 mm_Hg on the same or a decreased number of defined daily doses of medications.26 These criteria are endorsed by a large international study on how to assess outcome in PA.27 Patients with biochemical PA without lateralized aldosterone excess were held to have idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA), also known as bilateral adrenal hyperplasia.
Follow-Up Evaluation
The study flow chart is illustrated in Figure S1 in the online-only Data Supplement. Long-term outcome data were gathered using a predefined form from medical records for the patients who underwent regular follow-up visits or through phone interviews with patients, and relatives and their general practitioner when the patient was unavailable. The death/alive status was also verified by means of the National Health Care System Database, and each event was validated by the Adjudication Committee blind to the diagnosis.
End Points
The predetermined end points were total death (primary), cardiovascular deaths, major adverse cardiovascular events, and total cardiovascular events (all secondary). Cardiovascular death comprised sudden death, death because of congestive heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, or stroke, according to the Syst-Eur trial (Systolic Hypertension in Europe) criteria.28 Major adverse cardiovascular events entailed cardiovascular death and nonfatal acute coronary syndrome, stroke, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. Total cardiovascular events comprised major adverse cardiovascular event plus hospital admission for heart failure, atrial fibrillation, other arrhythmias, and myocardial revascularization (either surgical or percutaneous). Definitions and the end points, which followed the guidelines,28â31 are reported in detail in the online-only Data Supplement. Detection of arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, was performed by standard 12-lead electrocardiogram, followed, if necessary in the cases where paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was suspected, by 24-hour Holter monitoring.
Statistical Analysis
Log or square-root transformation of skewed variables was used to achieve a gaussian distribution, as appropriate. Comparison of quantitative variables across groups was done by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test; _2analysis was used to compare categorical data. The assumption that cases lost and available at follow-up did not differ was verified with multivariate regression analysis. Event rate (total and cardiovascular deaths, major adverse cardiovascular event, atrial fibrillation, and total cardiovascular events) was estimated with KaplanâMeier analysis (log-rank test). Cox stepwise (Wald) regression analysis with the inclusion and exclusion criteria of 0.05 and 0.10, respectively, was used to identify predictors of events. By protocol and given the low-risk features of the patients at baseline, a small number of events was expected, which limited the number of variables that could be included in a regression model. Accordingly, it was planned beforehand to use the procedure strategy described by Tabachnick and Fidell,32 in which the variables were entered in blocks: the first block comprised age and sex; the second, the diagnosis of hypertension, that is, PH and APA and IHA. We also tested interactions of age, sex, and hypertension diagnosis. Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05 for the primary end point and P<0.01 for secondary end points. SPSS Statistics, version 24 for MAC (IBM Corporation) was used for all analyses.
Results
After a median follow-up of 11.8 years (interquartile range, 11.6â12.0 years), data were gathered in 89.0% of the 1125 consecutive newly diagnosed hypertensive patients recruited in the whole cohort. In both PA subtypes, the baseline characteristics of the patients available at follow-up (Table 1) showed the expected biochemical phenotype, for example, lower serum K+, lower PRA, and higher PAC than the PH patients. The APA patients had a more florid PA phenotype, which means, lower serum K+ and PRA, and higher PAC, than the IHA patients; they were also older and showed a higher systolic BP than the PH patients, suggesting that they were at somewhat higher cardiovascular risk. No patients had experienced any cardiovascular events; however, 5 had a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation at recruitment (2 APA, 1 IHA, and 2 PH patients). Among PA patients with paroxysmal AF at baseline, 1 APA and 1 IHA patients had a recurrence of the arrhythmia. The other 6 AF detected at follow-up in PA were de novo arrhythmias. The rate of cases lost to follow-up was similar across the 3 diagnosis groups; moreover, cases lost and cases available at follow-up did not differ significantly at multivariate regression analysis (Table S1). Overall, the features of the PA and the PH groups are representative of those commonly seen in referred hypertensive patients, thus making a selection bias unlikely.
All patients were reported to have a good long-term BP control, and none required sympathetic renal denervation during follow-up in any groups. The BP control achieved during follow-up, although optimal by protocol in all 3 diagnosis groups, theoretically could have influenced outcome. Hence, we examined the BP values during follow-up (median 11.8 years) in 688 patients (61.1% of the cohort) distributed in all diagnosis groups. This analysis confirmed the good control of both systolic and diastolic BP values expected by protocol and, moreover, allowed to rule out differences across groups (PA adrenalectomized 128Â±10/80Â±7 mm_Hg, PA medically treated 132Â±10/81Â±8 mm_Hg, and PH 132Â±11/82Â±8 mm_Hg; all P=not significant).
Events at Follow-Up and Survival Analysis
All adrenalectomized patients were biochemically cured from PA, and no cases of recurrence of PA were recorded; â45% were also cured from hypertension, for example, were free from high BP with no drug treatment. Table 2 shows the incident events recorded, which were few as expected, given the low-risk of the population and the optimal management of hypertension at these specialized centers.
At Cox multivariate analysis in a regression model with age, the diagnosis group was identified as an independent predictor of atrial fibrillation (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.02â1.11; P=0.002): the medical treatment of PA patients was associated with an 82% increase of relative risk of atrial fibrillation compared with both APA and PH (hazard ratio, 1.82; 95% confidence interval, 1.08â3.08; P=0.025). An even greater relative risk of atrial fibrillation (hazard ratio, 2.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.31â4.00; P=0.004) was confirmed at a sensitivity analysis performed by adding estimated glomerular filtration rate to the Cox regression model.
Discussion
The longitudinal phase of the PAPY study provided a unique opportunity to prospectively assess the long-term outcome of PA patients assigned to target treatment based on demonstration of lateralized aldosterone excess, compared with optimally treated PH patients. To date, available outcome data on PA patients only came from retrospective surveys that documented an adverse prognostic effect of hyperaldosteronism in a rather consistent manner.12â14 In one such studies, PA patients were reported to be at higher cardiovascular risk than PH patients regardless of them being surgically or medically treated;12 at variance, in another larger study that examined PA patients by assignment to surgery or medical therapy, albeit in an insurance company database, there was a stronger effect of adrenalectomy on lowering mortality in spite of a relatively short (5.75 years) follow-up.14 The question on whether adrenalectomy or medical treatment of PA subtypes have the same long-term outcome, when studied prospectively with careful assignment to either treatment based on a predefined protocol, remained, therefore, unsettled.
We filled this gap of knowledge by examining the survival of PA patients in a large-scale prospective observational cohort study with long follow-up by treatment mode. This is, in our view, of much interest from the pathophysiological standpoint, because by protocol, patients diagnosed as APA had to be biochemically cured from the hyperaldosteronism after adrenalectomy, whereas, in contrast, the medically treated PA patients remained exposed to excess aldosterone because they received a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and all the additional drugs that were necessary to achieve an optimal long-term control of their high BP values, but the cause of aldosteronism was not eliminated.
By protocol, all patients had to achieve optimal control of BP values, which was confirmed by a sensitivity analysis, during the 11.8 years (median) of follow-up. This explains why our cohort overall showed a relatively low rate of deaths (4.0%) and major cardiovascular events (7.8%). These rates are similar to those found in cohort of similar age in the Framingham Heart Study33 and agree with the notion that uncomplicated hypertensive patients, who achieve a good control of BP values, are at low risk of events. Perhaps because of this low event rate, we could observe no significant differences in the primary end point (total death), between PA and PH at univariate (Figure 2A) and multivariate analyses, at variance with previous,12,13,34 but not all, studies.14
Given the accurate subtyping of PA patients accomplished in the PAPY study, we could examine the event-free survival by the PA subtype and related mode of treatment. We found that for all end points adrenalectomy translated into an event-free survival of PA patients similar to that of the optimally treated PH patients (Figure 2). These results supports the finding of a large survey performed in Taiwan14 but differ from the decreased cardiovascular events-free survival in PA patients found in retrospective survey.12,13,34 In fact, with the strength of its prospective design and careful assignment to surgery or long-term medical therapy based on PA subtyping, the present study provides compelling evidence for the superiority of surgery over medical treatment, thus extending to white the data in an Asian population.14
The significantly worse atrial fibrillationâfree survival found in the medically treated PA patients, in whom lifelong medical treatment was needed because of the persistent hyperaldosteronism, in both univariate (Figure 2) and multivariate analyses is a novel finding that agrees with a bulk of evidences coming from both experimental studies and clinical observations.35 This higher rate of incident atrial fibrillation can be explained considering that (1) in PA patients, the relative risk for atrial fibrillation is much higher (â7- to 12-fold) than that for other major cardiovascular end points in both retrospective15 and observational studies36 and (2) available knowledge from experimental and clinical studies implicate aldosteronism in causing atrial fibrillation in hypertensive patients.35
Additionally, it is worth noting that medically treated PA require not only treatment with multiple antihypertensive drugs but also an increased number (from 2.3 to 2.7) and doses of these drugs needed to warrant BP control over time.36 By contrast, even when not experiencing cure of the hypertension, which occurs in about half of the cases, in the adrenalectomized PA patients, the daily drug requirement commonly decreases (on average from 2.7 to 1.8).36 Hence, in the adrenalectomized PA patients, the improved atrial fibrillationâfree survival occurred notwithstanding a tapering of the medical therapy, whereas, conversely, in the medically treated PA patients, it arose in spite of an intensified drug treatment.
Limitations and Strengths
Some limitations are to be acknowledged in this study: first, as mentioned above, the PA patients were not randomly assigned to medical or surgical treatment because this was unacceptable ethically given that adrenalectomy is the best treatment that can be offered to PA patients with a lateralized form of PA. Second, the multicenter nature of the PAPY study reflects the management of hypertension at referral centers in a country with a relatively high standard of medical care and a capillary distribution of specialized hypertension centers, which suggests that generalization of its findings to countries/municipalities with a different level of medical care should be made with caution. Third, our low-risk cohort developed a small number of events, which could have hindered detection of differences between PH and PA patients in the rate of end points including cardiovascular death. On the contrary, it might also be argued that a selection bias occurred, because from the original cohort 11% of the patients were lost to follow-up, possibly those more likely to experience events than those harvested at follow-up.37 However, formal testing with regression analysis of patients lost and available to follow-up showed similar baseline features, including hypertension diagnosis (Table S1), suggesting that if this bias did occur, it probably marginally affected our conclusions. It might be claimed that another limitation, common to observational and even to randomized studies with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists,38 regards to the knowledge of the intensity of and adherence to drug treatment and degree of BP control during follow-up, 2 pieces of information notoriously difficult to harvest in long-term studies. However, by protocol, attending physicians at participating centers, mostly ESH Center of Excellence, were well instructed to reach BP control through yearly meetings throughout the entire duration of the study. Moreover, available data in the majority of the patients confirmed the excellent BP control achieved and, alongside the low number of events recorded, this makes major differences in long-term BP control across groups during follow-up altogether unlikely. Finally, as atrial fibrillation was diagnosed by strict criteria but can be asymptomatic, particularly if paroxysmal, it could be that some cases were overlooked, particularly in the group showing a higher incidence of the arrhythmia. However, if it did occur, this potential bias might have blunted differences between groups, rather than the opposite, thus emphasizing our conclusions.
Conclusions
This study shows that the PA patients treated medically, because of a failure to achieve a diagnosis of unilateral disease, have significantly higher incidence of atrial fibrillation than primary hypertensive patients with similar demographic features and similar BP values. This worse outcome was abrogated when the hyperaldosteronism was cured by adrenalectomy, because an aldosterone-producing adenoma could be identified.
Perspectives
With the strength of a prospective study and a painstaking assessment of events during an 11.8-year (median) follow-up, this study provides compelling evidence that the long-term prognosis can be substantively improved in PA patients with a potentially surgically curable subtype. Thus, a timely screening of PA followed by subtyping is a key step for the prevention of atrial fibrillation in hypertensive patients."

Background: Aldosterone plays a detrimental role on the cardiovascular system and PA patients display a higher risk of events compared with EH. 
Objectives: The objectives of the study were to compare cardio- and cerebrovascular events in patients with primary aldosteronism (PA) and matched essential hypertension (EH). 
Methods: We retrospectively compared the percentage of patients experiencing events at baseline and during a median follow-up of 12 years in 270 PA patients case-control matched 1:3 with EH patients and in PA subtypes [aldosterone-producing adenoma (n  57); bilateral adrenal hyper- plasia (n  213)] vs matched EH. 
Results: A significantly higher number of PA patients experienced cardiovascular events over the entire period of the study (22.6% vs 12.7%, P  .001). At the diagnosis of PA, a higher number of patients had experienced total events (14.1% vs 8.4% EH, P  .007); furthermore, during the follow-up period, PA patients had a higher rate of events (8.5% vs 4.3% EH, P  .008). In particular, stroke and arrhythmias were more frequent in PA patients. During the follow-up, a higher per- centage of PA patients developed type 2 diabetes. Parameters that were independently associated with the occurrence of all events were age, duration of hypertension, systolic blood pressure, presence of diabetes mellitus, and PA diagnosis. After division into PA subtypes, patients with either aldosterone-producing adenoma or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia displayed a higher rate of events compared with the matched EH patients. 
Conclusions: This study demonstrates in a large population of patients the pathogenetic role of aldosterone excess in the cardiovascular system and thus the importance of early diagnosis and targeted PA treatment. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 98: 4826â4833, 2013) 
Over the last 15 years, a wealth of studies has shed new light on the detrimental role of aldosterone in the cardiovascular system (1â3). These studies have shown that aldosterone per se, independent from its effects on blood pressure (BP) levels, can cause an increase in car- diovascular damage in different animal models and in hu- mans (1â 4). Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most fre- quent cause of secondary hypertension, and patients display an increased risk of target organ damage com- pared with essential hypertension (EH) with similar BP and risk profiles (5, 6). However, few studies have inves- tigated the rate of cardiovascular events in PA patients with matched EH. Milliez et al in 2005 (5) demonstrated an increased risk of events at diagnosis [stroke, myocardial infarction (MI) and atrial fibrillation (AF)] in 124 PA pa- tients compared with 456 matched EH. In a subsequent study, Catena et al (6) compared 54 PA patients with 323 EH at diagnosis and with 108 EH during a 7-year fol- low-up study. They demonstrated an increased risk of events (stroke, MI, and sustained arrhythmias) in PA pa- tients at diagnosis but no difference in the follow-up after adrenalectomy or therapy with a mineralocorticoid recep- tor-antagonist (MRA). Recently Savard et al (7) demon- strated an increased prevalence of cardiovascular compli- cations [coronary artery disease (CAD), nonfatal MI, heart failure, and AF] in a large population of PA patients (defined on the basis of high aldosterone to plasma renin activity ratio (ARR) and aldosterone levels but without performing confirmatory/exclusion tests), compared with controls. Unfortunately, PA subtype differentiation was not available (7). Finally, Born-Frontsberg et al (8) de- scribed the prevalence of cardiovascular events in a large population of 553 PA patients but a comparison with a matched population of EH was not performed. In these three studies, subtype differentiation was not performed by adrenal vein sampling (AVS) in most cases, a technique that is considered the only reliable means to distinguish patients with unilateral [aldosterone producing adenoma (APA) or unilateral adrenal hyperplasia from bilateral ad- renal disease (bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH)]. Fur- thermore, only in the study by Catena et al (6) did patients have a long-term follow-up. 
In the present retrospective study, we have investigated the rate of cardio- and cerebrovascular events in a large population of 270 PA patients compared with a matched (1:3) population of 810 EH during long-term follow-up (median 12 years), and we evaluate the most important predictors of events. Moreover, we evaluate the rate of events in PA subtypes compared with matched EH. Of note, 88% of PA patients underwent AVS, thus receiving the most accurate available subtype diagnosis. 
Materials and Methods 
Patient selection 
All PA patients diagnosed in our unit between January 1992 and December 2009 who had the last follow-up visit between January 2008 and December 2010 were included in this retro- spective study. 
The follow-up period was considered from the diagnosis of PA until the last visit in our unit. For BAH patients, MRA therapy was initiated immediately after subtype diagnosis, and the dose was targeted to obtain normal potassium and BP levels in absence of side effects (eplerenone was not available in our country at the time of the study); for APA patients adrenalectomy was per- formed within 3 months from the AVS diagnosis. Three matched EH patients were included as controls for each PA patient. PA and EH patients were matched 1:3 for sex, age, systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) levels at the first visit in our unit, duration of hypertension, body mass index (BMI), smoking hab- its, and comorbidity for type 2 diabetes mellitus. EH patients were selected randomly from our database (software Hyperma- condo) using the above-described criteria. 
Diagnosis of PA was performed as previously described. Briefly, the cutoff level considered as a positive ARR was 40 (nanograms per deciliter per nanogram per milliliter per 1 hour 1 ) (50 before 2001) together with an aldosterone level greater than 15 ng/dL. All antihypertensive drugs were stopped at least 3 weeks before the aldosterone and plasma renin activity (PRA) measurements; diuretics and spironolactone were stopped at least 6 and 8 weeks before measurements, respectively. Pa- tients who could not remain untreated received an -blocker (doxazosin) and/or a calcium channel blocker (verapamil or am- lodipine) during the screening, until the final diagnosis. The con- firmatory saline infusion test consisted of an iv saline load (2 L of 0.9% NaCl infused over 4 h) that was considered positive if posttest aldosterone levels were greater than 5 ng/dL (9). 
Subtype diagnosis was performed by computed tomography scanning with contrast and fine cuts of the adrenal and subse- quent AVS. Sampling was considered successful if the adrenal vein/inferior vena cava cortisol gradient was at least 3 (at least 2 before 2008) (10), and lateralization was defined as an aldoste- rone to cortisol ratio value (A/C) from one adrenal at least 4 times the ratio from the other adrenal gland or 3 times the A/C of the contralateral with the A/C in the contralateral less than the A/C in the peripheral vein. Two hundred thirty-seven PA patients (88%) underwent successful AVS (57 APA, 180 BAH), whereas 33 remained with an undetermined subtype for different reasons (they did not undergo AVS because of age/high risk for surgery, personal choice, or they underwent unsuccessful AVS). Most of these patients (n  30) had bilaterally normal appearance of the adrenal glands on computed tomography scanning, which in our hands was associated with a very high probability of BAH (95%) (11) and were treated with medical therapy. For this reason dur- ing the analysis of PA subtypes vs EH, these patients were in- cluded in the BAH group, whereas in the subtype comparison (APA vs BAH), they were excluded. A final diagnosis of APA was considered proven, providing that all the following conditions were satisfied: 1) histological demonstration of adenoma, 2) nor- malization of hypokalemia if present, 3) cure or improvement of hypertension, and 4) normalization of ARR and suppressibility of aldosterone levels less than 5 ng/dL under saline load (12). Finally, all patients with PA were screened for glucocorticoid- remediable aldosteronism using a long-PCR technique (13) and GRA patients were excluded from the present study. 
We considered the following cardiovascular events: MI and unstable angina requiring angioplasty (in the text grouped to- gether under CAD), stroke or transient ischemic attack (in the text together under stroke), sustained arrhythmias (AF, atrial flutter, sustained ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibril- lation) demonstrated by electrocardiogram, and heart failure (HF) requiring hospitalization. Hormonal parameters were de- termined as previously described (8 â10). Medical records of pa- tients were reviewed independently by two investigators (F.R., F.V.) who were blinded to patientsâ identification and diagnosis and who evaluated whether any of the major clinical events listed above had occurred. The study was approved by our local ethics committee. 
Statistical analysis 
Patients and controls were selected as described above. All data are expressed as mean  SD for normally distributed vari- ables and as median (25th to 75th percentile) for nonnormally distributed variables. The Student t test or the Kruskal-Wallis test was used for quantitative variables and the 2 test of the Fisher exact test for qualitative variables. The risk of events was expressed as odds ratio (OR)  95% confidence interval (CI). In the logistic regression analysis for factors associated with events, we included all variables significantly associated with the events in the univariate analysis. Sex, smoke habits, diagnosis of PA, and presence of diabetes were considered as dummy variables, whereas age, duration of hypertension, serum glucose, total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, creat- inine, potassium and aldosterone levels, and ARR were consid- ered as quantitative variables. Events analysis over time was per- formed using Kaplan-Meier curves and the Mantel test (log rank) was used for comparisons between curves. Analyses were per- formed with the IBM SPSS software version 19 and with the SAS version 8 software. 
Results 
Comparison between EH and PA patients 
Principal clinical and biochemical characteristics of the two patientsâ groups are summarized in Table 1. No dif- ferences were observed between the two groups for age, sex, duration of hypertension, SBP and DBP levels, smok- ing habits, BMI, and presence of type 2 diabetes as ex- pected from the design of the study. Interestingly, EH patients displayed an increased prevalence of hypercho- lesterolemia and higher levels of total and low-density li- poprotein (LDL) cholesterol. PA patients displayed higher prevalence of hypokalemia, lower potassium and PRA lev- els and higher aldosterone and ARR, as expected. 
During the total period between the diagnosis of hy- pertension and the end of follow-up (median 12 y for both groups), a significantly higher number of PA patients ex- perienced a cardiovascular event (22.6% vs 12.7%, P  .001; OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.4â2.8), and PA patients had higher number of events per patient compared with EH patients (0.30 vs 0.15) (Supplemental Table 1, published on The Endocrine Societyâs Journals Online web site at http://jcem.endojournals.org, and Figure 1). At diagnosis of PA, a higher number of patients had experienced events compared with EH (14.1% vs 8.4%, P  .007, OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.2â2.7), and also during the follow-up period, PA patients had a higher rate of events compared with EH patients (8.5% vs 4.3%, P  .008, OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2â 3.6) (Supplemental Table 1 and Figure 1). Kaplan-Meier estimates showing the incidence of the combined cardio- and cerebrovascular events in PA and EH patients (2  14.45; P  .0001) between the diagnosis of hypertension and the end of the study are available as Supplemental Material (Supplemental Figure 1). The analysis of event subtypes showed an increased prevalence of arrhythmias (OR 1.9; 95% CI 1.1â3.3), stroke (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.3â 3.7), and HF (OR 10.3; 95% CI 2.8 â37.9) (Table 2) dur- ing the total period of the study and an increased preva- lence of stroke (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.2â 4.0) and arrhythmias (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.1â 4.6) at diagnosis of PA compared with EH (Table 2). Interestingly, during the follow-up af- ter diagnosis of PA, only HF was more frequent in PA compared with EH (2.96% vs 0.12%), whereas the other cardiovascular events occurred with similar frequency (data not shown). 
We also compared the principal hormonal and bio- chemical parameters between groups at the end of the study (Table 3). Of note, a higher percentage of PA pa- tients developed type 2 diabetes (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.0 â2.3) compared with matched EH (and PA patients displayed a higher glucose levels compared with EH at the end of the follow-up period). Interestingly, potassium levels were no longer different between the two groups due to the specific therapy of PA patients (adrenalectomy or MRA). 
Comparison between patients with and without events 
Subsequently we compared pa- tients (PA and EH combined) with and without events during the study. Patients with events displayed signif- icantly higher age, SBP and DBP lev- els, and longer duration of hyperten- sion; were more frequently males, hypokalemic, and with type 2 diabe- tes; and had higher creatinine, trig- lycerides, glucose, aldosterone, and ARR and lower HDL cholesterol and PRA (Supplemental Table 1). Multivariate analysis showed that the parameters that were independently associated with the occurrence of all events were age (P  .001), duration of hypertension (P  .001), SBP (P  .01), presence of diabetes mellitus (P  .03), aldosterone levels (P  .04), and the diagnosis of PA (P  .001). The multivariate anal- ysis of variables associated with sustained arrhythmias were age (P  .001), duration of hypertension (P  .001), male sex (P  .04), and diagnosis of PA (P  .02); variables associated with stroke were age, duration of hypertension, and diagnosis of PA (all P  .001); variables associated with HF were duration of hypertension (P  .004) and diagnosis of PA (P  .001); and variables associated with CAD were duration of hypertension (P  .007), age (P  .04), aldosterone levels (P  .009), and glucose levels (P  .001). 
Comparison between PA subtypes and EH 
We compared patients with APA with matched patients with EH: a significantly higher number of APA patients had a cardiovascular event during the study (OR 4.0; 95% CI 1.9 â 8.3) and at diagnosis of PA (OR 5.2; 95% CI 2.2â12.6) (Table 2 and Figure 2A) but not during the fol- low-up period subsequent to PA diagnosis (Supplemental Table 2). In particular, APA patients experienced a higher rate of arrhythmias and stroke compared with matched EH both in the total period of the study (OR 4.9; 95% CI 1.3â18.0, P  .009, and OR 5.0; 95% CI 1.8 â13.8, P  .0008, respectively) and at diagnosis of PA (Figure 2A). 
We also analyzed the rate of events in BAH patients compared with matched EH patients. BAH patients dis- played a higher rate of events during the study period compared with EH (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.1â2.5): this dif- ference was predominantly due to an increased rate of events during the follow-up after the diagnosis of PA (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.05â3.7) compared with the rate of events at diagnosis (Table 2). This result was not affected by the removal of the PA patients of undetermined subtype from the BAH group. Analysis of event type revealed a nonsig- nificant trend for more frequent arrhythmias and stroke and a significantly higher rate of HF in the BAH group compared with EH (Table 2). Interestingly, BAH patients experienced a higher rate of events compared with EH patients despite similar BP levels and despite displaying lower LDL cholesterol levels (Supplemental Table 3). It should be noted, however, that the BAH patients dis- played significantly higher glucose levels than the EH pa- tients at the end of the study (Supplemental Table 3). 
Comparison between APA and BAH patients 
Finally, we compared PA subtypes, APA and BAH. It should be underlined that in this comparison patients were not matched for any variables. Clinical and biochemical parameters of APA and BAH patients are summarized in Supplemental Table 4. APA patients displayed lower po- tassium and higher aldosterone and ARR levels as ex- pected. Patients with APA displayed a higher rate of events 
compared with BAH patients both in the total period of the study (OR 3.6; 95% CI 1.7â7.3) and at the diagnosis of PA (OR 5.2; 95% CI 2.2â12.6) but not during the follow-up after di- agnosis. The evaluation of the type of events showed that APA patients more frequently experienced CAD (OR 9.9; 95% CI 1.01â97.5), stroke (OR 4.9; 95% CI 1.5â16.1), and ar- rhythmias (OR 4.1; 95% CI 1.2â 14.0) before the diagnosis of PA compared with BAH patients and CAD and stroke during the total time of the study. Interestingly, among the total PA group, hypokalemic pa- tients displayed an increased rate of events (P  .03) and had higher SBP, DBP, and aldosterone levels (data not shown). Finally, we observed a greater SBP and DBP reduction after adrenalectomy in APA patients com- pared with BAH patients after phar- macological therapy with MRA (P  .03). In the total PA group, we also compared patients with events and without: PA patients with cardiovascular events were older, with a longer duration of hypertension and higher SBP and were more frequently males and hypokalemic. 
Discussion 
In the present study, we demonstrate an increased rate of cardio- and cerebrovascular events in a large population of primary aldosteronism patients compared with matched essential hypertensive patients. 
We carefully matched of 270 PA with 810 EH patients for the most important variables to reduce the effect of factors that have been shown to increase the rate of car- diovascular events in hypertensive patients. In particular, our PA patients were matched 1:3 with EH for sex, age, and SBP and DBP levels at the first visit to our unit, du- ration of hypertension, BMI, smoking habits, and comor- bidity for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Importantly, most the PA patients underwent subtype diagnosis using AVS, thus allowing the subdivision of the PA patients into APA and BAH: the comparison of the rate of cardiovascular events in APA and BAH compared with matched EH has not been performed in previous studies. 
We showed that PA patients experienced cardiovascu- lar events (MI or unstable angina requiring angioplasty, stroke or transient ischemic attack, sustained arrhythmias including AF, atrial flutter, sustained ventricular tachy- cardia and ventricular fibrillation, and heart failure re- quiring hospitalization) more frequently than those with EH, both at PA diagnosis, during the follow-up and in the overall period of the study. This confirms and extends previous findings of increased cardiovascular morbidity in PA patients (5â7, 14). Interestingly, PA patients displayed a higher number of events compared with EH despite showing significantly lower total and LDL cholesterol lev- els. This difference in cholesterol levels was also observed in the study by Milliez et al (5). The event analysis shows that arrhythmias and stroke were more frequent both dur- ing the total period of the study and at diagnosis, whereas HF was also more frequent during the follow-up. The in- creased frequency of stroke in PA patients has been ob- served both in sporadic (5, 6) and familial forms (15) and has been attributed at least in part to the direct effect of aldosterone on the vessel wall inducing inflammation, fi- brosis, and remodeling (16, 17). Interestingly, in sponta- neously hypertensive stroke-prone rats, an animal model of secondary aldosterone excess, therapy with MRA re- duces the rate of stroke despite having no effect on BP levels (1, 18). The increased rate of sustained arrhythmias could be determined both by hypokalemia, increased QT interval in the electrocardiogram, increased in the myo- cardial fibrosis and ion channel remodeling (19 â21). Con- sistently, a pivotal role of aldosterone and mineralocorti- coid receptor activation in the determination of AF and ventricular arrhythmias has been shown in animal models (21, 22). Finally, the detrimental effect of aldosterone in the pathogenesis of heart failure is supported not only by the direct effects on cardiomyocytes (23) but also by the protective effects of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist on patients with reduced ventricular function (24). 
Intriguingly, PA patients developed type 2 diabetes more frequently during the study period compared with EH. This is consistent with previous findings indicating a higher prevalence of diabetes in PA patients compared with EH patients (25) and a role of aldosterone in glucose metabolism alterations, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome (26, 27). 
It should be noted that in the multivariate analysis, together with the expected determinants associated with cardiovascular events such as age, SBP, and duration of hypertension, the PA status was independently associated with an increased risk of experience total events, stroke, arrhythmias, and heart failure. 
The comparison of patients with APA with matched EH patients demonstrated that APA patients experience a higher rate of total events, arrhythmias, and stroke, both in the total period of the study and until diagnosis of PA but not during the follow-up period after adrenalectomy. Most of the difference in the event rate between APA and matched EH was due to events before the diagnosis of PA and subsequent adrenalectomy, highlighting the impor- tance of early diagnosis and treatment of these patients. Also the comparison between BAH and matched EH pa- tients showed an increased rate of total events in BAH; among the events, despite a trend for stroke and arrhyth- mias, only heart failure displayed a significantly higher rate in BAH compared with EH patients, but this may have been due to the relatively small numbers of events. Inter- estingly, the rate of total events during the follow-up was greater in BAH compared with EH despite showing no differences in BP levels (or even a tendency toward lower levels) and lower cholesterol levels. This suggests that al- dosterone plays a detrimental role independent of its effect on BP: in fact, the only parameter that was significantly altered in BAH patients was the glucose levels. It is there- fore conceivable that PA patients should be considered at an increased risk based on the higher aldosterone produc- tion and thus a lower BP target (for example,  130/80 mm Hg) may be appropriate as in patients with previous cardiovascular events. 
The comparative analysis of patients with APA vs those with BAH (not matched for any variables) yielded further observations of interest. APA patients experienced car- diovascular events (and particularly coronary events, strokes, and arrhythmias) more frequently than BAH pa- tients. Given that cholesterol levels were not different be- tween the two groups, other factors (including higher al- dosterone levels) presumably accounted for the higher rate of coronary disease in APA patients. During the follow-up period, by contrast, the rate of cardiovascular events was similar in APA and BAH, suggesting a greater beneficial response of APA to adrenalectomy vs that of BAH to MRA. The reduction in BP levels was significantly greater in APA patients who underwent adrenalectomy compared with BAH patients treated with MRA. These observations support the importance of adrenalectomy in APA patients as the optimal approach to reducing cardiovascular risk and hence the necessity of careful subtype differentiation during the diagnostic workup of PA. In addition, BAH patients also displayed an increased rate of events, high- lighting that even mild forms of aldosterone excess deter- mine detrimental effects on the cardiovascular system and therefore should be carefully investigated and specifically treated. 
The present study and those published previously in PA subjects (5â 8) are coherent with previous studies on ani- mal models showing that aldosterone is responsible for increased left ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, and ne- crosis (1â 4); perivascular inflammation, fibrosis, and en- dothelial dysfunction (1â 4); and glomerular ischemia and sclerosis and for mesangial fibrosis (1â 4). Furthermore, aldosterone has been involved in the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome by reducing insulin sensitivity by activating oxidative stress and inflammation by impair- ing insulin receptor signaling and inhibiting glucose transport (28). 
Strengths of our study include the fact that it is the largest in terms of the number of PA patients evaluated in this fashion, the careful approach to matching 1:3 with EH for a large number of confounding variables, and the care- ful PA subtype differentiation. 
This study has some potential limitations: 1) the retro- spective nature of the study; 2) we cannot exclude the possibility of having missed some mild forms of PA and/or having considered some forms of low-renin essential hy- pertension as PA due to the overlapping of these condi- tions (some units use different cutoffs for screening and confirmatory tests); 3) we paid particular attention to the detection and definition of the events, but, due to the na- ture of the study, we cannot completely rule out the pos- sibility of having missed a minority of events; and 4) even if BP levels were similar between BAH and EH patients, even at the end of the study, we cannot rule out the pos- sibility of incomplete therapeutic compliance for BAH pa- tients (or insufficient MR blockade), especially for males, due to sex-related side effects.
Taken together, the results of the present study further confirm in a large population of patients the pathogenetic role of aldosterone in the cardiovascular system and thus the importance of early diagnosis of this condition. In fact, at PA diagnosis patients had a median duration of hyper- tension of 5 years and already displayed a higher rate of cardiovascular events compared with matched EH. Fur- thermore, this study indicates that APA patients display a poorer prognosis compared with those with BAH, prob- ably determined by a more florid condition of hyperaldo- steronism but with abrogation of this excess morbidity after adrenalectomy, thereby emphasizing the importance of differentiating PA subtypes in these patients."

Therefore, we aimed to elucidate how age affects the clinical outcomes after treatments. We analyzed 153 older (\xe2\x89\xa5\xe2\x80\x8965\xc2\xa0years) and 702 younger patients (<\xe2\x80\x8965\xc2\xa0years) with uPA, treated either with ADX or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) in the Japan PA Study, and compared the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or blood pressure over a 36-month period after treatments. ADX-treated patients showed severer biochemical indicators than MRA-treated patients. During 6 and 36\xc2\xa0months, the eGFR decreased more prominently in older but not in younger patients with ADX than in those with MRA, which remained significant after adjustment with the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). There was a significant interaction between the age-groups and the treatment choices in the change of the eGFR with IPTW-adjusted analysis. The post-treatment dose of antihypertensive medication was lower in younger and higher in older patients with ADX than those with MRA. The clinical benefit of ADX differed between younger and older patients with uPA. These findings indicate the need for further validation on whether ADX can benefit older patients with uPA. Introduction Primary aldosteronism (PA), a major cause of secondary hypertension, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) as well as renal disease, via activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Indeed, inappropriate aldosterone secretion is known to play a role in renal injury development. The current guidelines recommend adrenalectomy (ADX) for unilateral PA (uPA), or MR antagonists (MRAs) for bilateral PA, as PA-specific treatments. However, the effect of ADX on clinical outcome varies primarily depending on the baseline characteristics of patients including sex, obesity, and age. The Japan PA Study (JPAS) investigation group reported that remission of hypertension or reduction of antihypertensives shortly after ADX (6 or 12\xc2\xa0months) was limited in older patients (\xe2\x89\xa5\xe2\x80\x8965\xc2\xa0years old) compared with that in younger patients. We found that the appearance of renal impairment (chronic kidney disease (CKD)\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa5\xe2\x80\x89stage 3b) shortly after ADX was more frequent in older patients. Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether poorer clinical outcomes after ADX in older patients are attributed to different treatment benefits or are a simple reflection of different background characteristics between older and younger patients. To answer this question, it is necessary to compare the patients with ADX to those with the different treatment choice, namely medical treatment with MRA. In this study, we analyzed patients with uPA, treated with either ADX or MRA, to clarify whether the benefit of ADX to renal function and blood pressure (BP) compared to MRA differs between older and younger patients with uPA. Methods Study population and follow-up after specific treatments Study flowchart. BP, blood pressure; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; MRA, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist; PA, primary aldosteronism. This was a retrospective observational study that was part of the JPAS. The data of patients aged 20\xe2\x80\x9390\xc2\xa0years old with PA who underwent adrenal venous sampling (AVS) at 41 referral centers in Japan between January 2006 and December 2018 were collected as described previously. Diagnosis of PA was based on the Japanese guidelines. Of 1039 patients with uPA and the fully available data at baseline, 184 patients without follow up data on BP or eGFR were excluded. We then analyzed 153 older (\xe2\x89\xa5\xe2\x80\x8965\xc2\xa0years) and 702 younger patients (<\xe2\x80\x8965\xc2\xa0years) (Fig.\xc2\xa01). Both collected BP and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were analyzed at baseline, 6, 12, or 36\xc2\xa0months after performing an ADX or initiating MRA treatments. Additionally, we extracted 66 older and 309 younger patients with available eGFRs at 36\xc2\xa0months for propensity score-matched analysis using the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) (Fig.\xc2\xa01). The decision on whether to perform an ADX or initiate MRA treatment was dependent on the judgement of patients and their attending physicians following classification of the PA subtype. Further, the dose or class of antihypertensives were decided by the attending physician at each center. Analysis of patient characteristics and clinical outcomes Each patient\xe2\x80\x99s data were obtained from the medical records of each referral center. The BP levels in the seated position at outpatient clinics were obtained from medical records. The serum creatinine was measured by the enzyme method. eGFR was calculated using the following equation established for the Japanese population: eGFR (ml/min/1.73 m2)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89194\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89serum creatinine\xe2\x88\x921.094\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89age\xe2\x88\x920.287 (\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x890.739 for female patients). Plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) and plasma renin activity were measured in the supine position, using commercially available kits, as detailed in previous JPAS reports. Hypokalemia or hyperkalemia was defined as a serum potassium concentration\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x893.5\xc2\xa0mEq/L or use of a potassium supplement, or as a serum potassium concentration\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x895.0\xc2\xa0mEq/L, respectively. The presence of proteinuria was defined as a positive reaction in the urine dipstick test. Clinical or biochemical success after ADX was assessed using the Primary Aldosterone Surgical Outcome criteria. Briefly, complete biochemical success was defined as a normalization of the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (<\xe2\x80\x89200) in the absence of hypokalemia. In addition, complete clinical success was defined as a normal BP without antihypertensive medication, whereas partial clinical success was defined as the same BP as before adrenalectomy with less antihypertensive medication or a reduction in BP with either the same or less antihypertensive medication. Antihypertensive medication was expressed as defined daily dose (DDD). In this study, composite cardiovascular events were defined as myocardial infarction, angina, stoke, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, peripheral artery diseases, or unplanned hospitalization related to any other cardiovascular diseases. Analysis of AVS The lateralization index (LI) was calculated by dividing the aldosterone to cortisol ratio on the dominant side with that on the nondominant side by AVS with cosyntropin stimulation. The contralateral ratio was calculated by dividing the aldosterone to cortisol ratio in the non-dominant side to that in the inferior vena cava. The details of the AVS procedure were previously described. The LI\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x894 or 2\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89LI\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x894 and contralateral ratio\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x891 was defined as uPA. Statistical analysis Continuous variables were expressed as mean\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x89standard deviation or as the median (interquartile range). Categorical variables were expressed as absolute frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Differences in parametric and non-parametric variables were assessed by the Student\xe2\x80\x99s t-test and Mann\xe2\x80\x93Whitney U test, respectively. The significance of differences between independent categorical variables was assessed using the Chi-squared test or Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s exact test. We calculated the Pearson correlation coefficients between the percentage change in eGFR from baseline to 36-month after PA-specific treatments in ADX or MRA group. We used mixed effects models for repeated measures to analyze the differences in the effect of PA-specific treatments on the temporal change in eGFR and systolic BP. We compared the differences in temporal changes of eGFRs between treatment choices (ADX or MRA) during a 3-year period, with or without the use of IPTW. To calculate the propensity scores, we used a logistic regression using gender, age, body mass index, systolic BP, log-transformed PAC, eGFR, the DDD of antihypertensives, and the presence of hypokalemia at baseline as covariates, as well as the treatment choices as a dependent variable. Weighting, with 1/propensity score in ADX-treated patients and 1/(1-propensity score) in MRA-treated patients, was performed to estimate the average treatment effect. The standardized difference was calculated to evaluate the balance of each confounding factor between the treatments, and the standardized difference of\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.1 was considered well-balanced. A generalized linear model was used to evaluate the percent change in eGFRs in younger or older ADX-treated patients compared to MRA-treated patients with either unadjusted or IPTW-adjusted data. Finally, the p-values were calculated to assess the interaction between the age-groups and the treatment choices in the percent change in the eGFRs. p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05 were considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed using JMP 15.3.0 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and SPSS statistics 27 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Ethics The study was conducted according to the guidelines for clinical studies published by the Ministry of Health and Labor, Japan, and it was approved by the ethics committee of the National Hospital Organization Kyoto Medical Center, as the project leader center, and by the institutional ethics committees of the participating centers. Informed consent was obtained in the form of opt-out on the web-site of each referral center. This observational study was registered at UMIN ID 000018756.

(A) Adrenalectomy, (B) Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. The significant correlation was observed in 247 patients with ADX (r\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x890.27, p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.01) but not in 128 patients with MRA (r\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x890.07, p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.43). ADX, adrenalectomy; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; MRA, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. We first analyzed the correlation between age at baseline and decline in eGFR during 36\xc2\xa0months after medical or surgical treatment of uPA.

The p-values of clinical success or complete biochemical success represent the comparison between older and younger patients treated with ADX. ADX, adrenalectomy; MRA, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. The prevalence of complete clinical success after ADX that indicates the cure of hypertension was significantly higher in younger patients than older patients (Table 2). In contrast, the prevalence of complete biochemical success after ADX that indicates the cure of PA was similarly high both in younger and older patients (Table 2). There was no significant difference in the post-treatment occurrence of the composite cardiovascular events for 36\xc2\xa0months between patients with MRA and with ADX in both age-groups (Table 2).

A mixed effects model for repeated measures revealed that eGFR reduced more prominently with ADX than with MRA in both age groups during 3\xc2\xa0years (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001) (A,B). However, the decline in eGFR from 6 to 36\xc2\xa0months was more prominent in patients with ADX than in those with MRA in older (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.039) (A), but not in younger patients (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.26) (B).

In contrast, the eGFR decreased to a greater extent in older patients with ADX than MRA-treated patients between the 6 to 36\xc2\xa0months after treatment (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.039); however, this difference was not observed in younger patients during this time period (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.26) (Fig.\xc2\xa03). There was no significant difference in the post-treatment prevalence of proteinuria between ADX and MRA in both younger and older patients who had data at 6 or 12\xc2\xa0months (Table 2).

Standardized differences of each covariate between the treatments before (unadjusted) and after the adjustment with IPTW (IPTW-adjusted) are as follows: Gender, 0.10 and 0.01; age, 0.35 and 0.02; body mass index, 0.17 and 0.05; SBP, 0.24 and 0.01; log-transformed PAC, 0.54 and 0.03; eGFR, 0.15 and 0.05; the DDD of antihypertensives, 0.06 and 0.04; the presence of hypokalemia, 0.50 and 0.00, respectively. p-value for the interaction between the age groups and the treatment choices (ADX or MRA). ADX, adrenalectomy; CI, confidence interval; DDD, daily defined dose, eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; IPTW, inverse probability of treatment weighting; MRA, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist; PAC, plasma aldosterone concentration; SBP, systolic blood pressure. Finally, to reduce the selection bias for a PA-specific treatment, we adjusted with IPTW using the PS to analyze the available eGFR at 36\xc2\xa0months among patients (Fig.\xc2\xa01). Gender, age, body mass index, systolic BP, log-transformed PAC, eGFR, the DDD of antihypertensives, and the presence of hypokalemia at baseline were used as covariates to calculate the PS. All of the standardized differences of IPTW-adjusted covariates between the treatments were less than 0.1, indicating that the IPTW sufficiently balanced the patient\xe2\x80\x99s backgrounds between treatments (Table 4). A generalized linear model with the IPTW-adjusted analysis indicated that the percent change in the eGFR from the baseline to 36-month in ADX was 17.0% or 4.7% greater than the MRA treatment in older or younger patients, respectively (Table 4). There was a significant interaction between the age-groups and the PA treatments in the percent change of the eGFR, indicating that the influence of the treatment of choice on the percent change of the eGFR differed between younger and older patients. When the 36-month period used to calculate the eGFR was divided into the initial (0\xe2\x80\x936\xc2\xa0months) and late (6\xe2\x80\x9336\xc2\xa0months) phases, we found that ADX enhanced the initial phase change in eGFR compared to MRA in both age groups; however, the interaction between the age groups and the treatment choices was not significant. In contrast, the late phase eGFR in ADX was 9.4% greater than that in MRA in older patients with IPTW-adjusted analysis; however, there was no treatment-associated difference in the younger patients. There was a significant interaction between the age-groups and the treatment choices in the late phase change in eGFR. Discussion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the impact of age on the clinical outcome of ADX in comparison to MRA in patients with uPA. The primary findings of the present study are as follows: the significant correlation between the change in eGFR (0\xe2\x80\x9336\xc2\xa0months) and age was observed in patients with ADX, but not in patients with MRA; the ADX treatment lowered the eGFR compared with the MRA treatment during a 36-month period in both older and younger patients; a late phase (6\xe2\x80\x9336\xc2\xa0months) decline in the eGFR was higher with the ADX treatment than with the MRA treatment in older patients but not in younger patients; the post-treatment dose of antihypertensive medication was lower in younger and higher in older patients with ADX than those with MRA; the late phase decline in eGFR with the ADX treatment was greater than that with the MRA treatment in older patients but not in younger patients with the IPTW-adjusted analysis; there was a significant interaction between the age-groups and the treatment choices in the change of eGFR during the total 36-month period or the late phase with the IPTW-adjusted analysis. The blockade of renal impairment has been considered as a crucial treatment benefit expected by ADX in patients with uPA. This notion was supported by the work by Hundemer et al. who reported that ADX in patients with PA might mitigate the risk for developing CKD, whereas treatment with MRA was associated with a higher risk for developing CKD when compared to essential hypertension. We found that the eGFR during the late phase decreased to a greater extent in older patients that received the ADX treatment than the MRA-treated patients; however, this difference was not observed in younger patients. It should be noted that in both age groups, biochemical parameters of PA were higher in patients with ADX than patients with MRA. These differences probably reflect the real-world clinical practice in that disease severity can be a determinant for surgical treatment in uPA. Nevertheless, the IPTW-adjusted analysis raised the possibility that the ADX treatment could prominently decrease renal function compared to MRA-treated patients, even with patients that had equivalent clinical backgrounds. We also found a significant interaction between the age-groups and PA-specific treatments in the change of the eGFR with IPTW-adjusted analysis, which suggest that the impact of the treatment of choice in uPA on a patient\xe2\x80\x99s renal function differs depending on the patient\xe2\x80\x99s age. It is widely known that glomerular hyperfiltration is followed by the development of proteinuria and renal damage due to renal sclerosis. Previous studies have indicated that the initial decline in eGFR following PA-specific treatments is primarily caused by cancellation of hyperfiltration due to excessive aldosterone release. We found that the initial decline in eGFR was smaller with the MRA treatment than with ADX, which could theoretically provide complete resolution of aldosterone excess. Nevertheless, normalization of glomerular hyperfiltration by ADX did not appear to prevent the development of renal injury during the late phase in older patients, compared to that in patients with MRA, or in younger patients with ADX (Fig.\xc2\xa02, Table 2). A recent JPAS study reported higher age was identified as an independent factor associated with a large initial decline in eGFR in patients treated with either ADX or MRA. The findings suggest that older patients with PA are susceptible to developing glomerular injury from an early phase after PA-specific treatments. Aging is known to induce significant changes in the structure and function of the kidney. The structural changes in kidneys could make older people prone to glomerular damage in response to a drastic change in renal hemodynamics. Therefore, rapid reduction in renal blood flow after PA treatment might have caused a decline in glomerular capillary pressure as well as irreversible glomerular damage in older patients. This supposition is supported by several clinical studies showing that older patients have a higher risk of irreversible glomerular damage due to an acute decline in glomerular filtration. Together with the potency from ADX treatment that drastically reduces renal blood flow, it is conceivable that the negative influence of age on renal outcome may be greater with ADX treatment than with MRA treatment. The current findings also suggest that the efficacy of ADX on BP regulation beyond MRA was obvious in younger patients with uPA but not in older patients. Although the temporal change in BP was not statistically different between ADX and MRA in both age groups (Fig.\xc2\xa03), the DDD except for MRAs after the specific treatments was lower with ADX than with MRA treatment in younger patients (Table 1). Notably, the treatment-associated difference was opposite in older patients (Table 1). Again, it should be noted that the biochemical severity is different between patients with ADX and with MRA, potentially interfering the pure comparison between the treatments. Nevertheless, the current findings provide an obvious contrast in the treatment effects of ADX between older and younger patients in BP regulation. Finally, it should be noted that the age-specific difference in the impact of the treatment on renal outcome is independent of that on the BP regulation, as BP control itself is not different between the treatments both in younger and older patients (Fig.\xc2\xa03). There are several limitations in the present study. First, there are the treatment\xe2\x80\x93associated differences in biochemical severity of PA that may interfere with the direct comparison between treatments. While our findings were strengthened by the consistency after the IPTW-adjusted analysis, future studies are required to validate that the ADX treatment is not beneficial in preserving renal function in older patients with uPA. Second, this was a multi-center retrospective observational study. As a strategy for specific treatments for PA was not pre-designed, the choice of treatments depended on the physicians. Particularly, Ohno Y et al. reported that the choice of ADX for uPA classified based on AVS was less frequent in Japanese than in European centers (78.2% vs 91.4%) from the international multicenter retrospective study on the Adrenal Venous Sampling Stats in Primary Aldosteronism (AVSTAT study). The cause of non-surgical treatment for the patients with uPA was more likely to be physician-derived, including good BP control, normokalemia, and the absence of adrenal lesions on imaging before AVS, in Japan. Although the exact reason for this discrepancy remains unknown, it is conceivable that relatively mild uPA is more often diagnosed in Japan, compared with Europe. This country-specific difference may potentially influence on the generalizability of the present findings. Third, the medication adherence of MRA might be the potential confounding effect compared with ADX. Forth, we did not investigate the onset of CVDs, which are important complications for the vital outcomes of PA patients. Fifth, the 36-month follow-up period in this study is a relatively short period for assessing the long-term clinical outcomes. Together, prospective studies with long-term observation of outcomes including CVDs, will be required to determine the adequate specific treatments for PA in older patients. Finally, similar to most previous reports, we used only office BP measurement. Thus, the white coat effect might have influenced the BP data. In conclusion, in younger patients with uPA, ADX could provide benefit by protecting chronic decline of renal function and resolving hypertension. In contrast, older patients with uPA experienced prominent post-treatment reduction of eGFR as well as poor improvement of hypertension. These findings suggest that older patients need careful monitoring after ADX. The limitations of this retrospective study hinder a direct comparison of the net treatment benefits; thus, future studies are needed to clarify if ADX can benefit older patients with uPA.

Abstract. Patients with aldosterone-producing adenomas are treated using surgery, and patients with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism receive medical treatment using mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs). However, the outcomes of surgical and medical treatment for primary aldosteronism (PA) remain unclear. Therefore, we compared the outcomes of surgical and medical treatment for PA and aimed to identify a specific subgroup that might benefit from medical treatment. We identified 269 patients who were treated for PA (unilateral excess: 221 cases; bilateral excess: 48 cases) during 2000â2015 at the Seoul National University Hospital and two other tertiary centers. The main outcomes were the amelioration of hypertension and hypokalemia. Treatment improved hypertension in the surgical treatment group (78.2%) and the medical treatment group (55.6%) (p = 0.001). At the last follow-up, hypokalemia was normalized in the surgical treatment group (97.1%) and the medical treatment group (93.7%, p = 0.046). Among patients with unilateral aldosterone excess, surgery provided advantages in resolving hypertension without worsening renal function. Among patients who were >60 years old or had impaired renal function, surgical and medical treatment provided similar amelioration of hypokalemia and hypertension. Three patients developed hyperkalemia after surgery, and no patients developed hyperkalemia after initiating medical treatment. The surgical treatment group exhibited a lower postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and higher serum potassium levels, compared to the medical treatment group. Surgical treatment provided better hypertension and hypokalemia outcomes among patients with PA, compared to medical treatment. However, MRAs may be appropriate for elderly patients with impaired renal function. 
Key words: Outcome, Primary aldosteronism, Mineralocorticoid antagonist, Aldosterone-producing adenoma 
IN CASES of primary aldosteronism (PA), subtype differentiation is crucial for selecting an appropriate treatment. For example, surgery (e.g., laparoscopic adrenalectomy) is recommended for unilateral aldo- sterone excess, and medication (e.g., mineralocorti- coid receptor antagonists [MRAs]) is recommended for bilateral aldosterone excess [1]. Furthermore, medical treatment is recommended if the patient is unable or unwilling to undergo surgery [1]. However, the relative efficacies of medical and surgical therapy for PA remain unclear. For example, one study found that surgery for PA provided better hypertension and hypokalemia management, compared to medication [2]. Another recent study compared patients with unilateral lesions who underwent surgery and patients with bilateral lesions who received medical manage- ment, and revealed that surgery provided superior cardiovascular outcomes after 2.5 years [3]. In addi- tion, surgery can eliminate the possible side effects of MRAs and is a more cost-effective treatment, com- pared to lifelong medical therapy [4-6]. Nevertheless, other reports have described similar cardiovascular outcomes after treatment using surgery or medica- tion [7, 8]. Reincke et al. have also demonstrated that there was no difference blood pressure and hypoka- lemia outcomes [9], while Muth et al. have reported similar cardiovascular and renal outcomes among patients who received medication or surgery [10]. 
Moreover, patients with PA experience similar reduc- tions in their left ventricular mass after being treated using surgery or medication [11]. 
Up to 10% of surgically-treated patients with PA experience surgery-related complications [12]. In addition, laparoscopic adrenalectomy alone is not suf- ficient for controlling blood pressure and provides varying rates of control (33â85%) [12]. Intriguingly, a retrospective analysis of 40 patients with bilateral aldosterone excess reported that 15% of the patients experienced blood pressure normalization after unilat- eral adrenalectomy [13]. However, few studies have compared outcomes from the same type of treatment in patients with the same PA subtypes. 
In clinical practice, we regularly encounter patients with undiagnosed PA who have already experienced disease-related complications, such as renal and/or heart failure. In addition, a few patients experience decreased renal function and require renal replace- ment therapy after adrenalectomy. Therefore, we questioned whether surgery should always be recom- mended for patients with unilateral lesions and oper- able status. In the present study, we aimed to compare the outcomes from surgical and medical treatments for patients with PA (i.e., unilateral aldosterone excess) and to identify a specific patient subgroup that might benefit from medical treatment. 
Materials and Methods 
This retrospective study evaluated medical records from patients who were admitted during 2000â2015 to the Seoul National University Hospital (n = 199), Seoul Metropolitan Government Boramae Medical Center (n = 26), and Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (n = 44). Confirmatory testing was performed for patients with hypertension who exhib- ited an increased plasma aldosterone to renin activity ratio (â¥20) and plasma aldosterone levels of >15 ng/dL. Cases of PA were confirmed using the saline infusion test [1]. The patientâs subtype was assigned based on adrenal gland computed tomography and adrenal venous sampling results. Unilateral aldosterone excess was identified using cut-off values of >4:1 for the cor- tisol-corrected aldosterone ratio (high-side:low-side) and <1.0 from the low side to the inferior vena cava. The presence of an aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) was identified using pathological confirma- tion of an adrenal adenoma and correction of the 
hyperaldosteronism or marked improvement of the hypertension after adrenalectomy. Before confirming the diagnosis, all antihypertensive medications were changed to calcium channel blockers or alpha-adren- ergic receptor blockers, which do not interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. 
Among 273 eligible patients, we excluded 4 patients who did not have unilateral or bilateral lesions. Thus, 269 patients were included in the final analysis. This studyâs design was approved by the institutional review board of Seoul National University Hospital, and the study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. 
Outcome variables 
Hypertension remission was defined as the patient achieving a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of <140 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of <90 mmHg without the use of anti-hypertensive medica- tion. Hypertension improvement was defined as any decrease in the number or dose of the anti-hyperten- sive medications. Hypokalemia was defined as lowest serum potassium levels of <3.5 mmol/L, and hypokale- mia normalization was defined as serum potassium lev- els of â¥3.5 mmol/L after treatment. 
Data regarding age, sex, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), duration of hypertension, plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), serum potassium levels, serum creatinine levels, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were retrieved from the patientsâ medical records. The initial blood pressure was recorded at the first outpatient visit. Fasting blood samples (8â9 AM) were obtained as quickly as possible using a tourniquet with the patient in the seated posi- tion, and the PRA measurement was performed using either Renin RIA beads (before 2011; TFB Inc., Tokyo, Japan) or a PRA radioimmunoassay kit (after 2011; TFB Inc.), which had intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variations of 3.8% and 6.7%, respectively. Levels of PAC were determined using a radioimmunoassay with the SPAC-S aldosterone kit (TFB Inc.), which had intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation of 4.7% and 4.5%, respectively. The normal reference ranges for PRA and PAC levels were 0.3â2.9 ng/mL/h and 3â16 ng/dL, respectively. 
Statistical analyses 
All data were expressed as n (%) or mean Â± stan- dard deviation. The independent-samples t-test and _2 
test were used to compare continuous and categorical variables, respectively. We also used propensity score matching (2:1) to create age-, sex-, and BMI-matched subgroups to compare the surgical and medical treat- ments. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 18; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL), and differences with a p-value of <0.05 were consid- ered statistically significant. 
Results 
Unilateral lesions were diagnosed in 221 patients (APA, n = 218; unilateral adrenal hyperplasia, n = 3) and bilateral lesions were diagnosed in 48 patients (Fig. 1). Among the 221 patients with unilateral lesions, sur- gery was performed for 205 patients, and 16 patients who refused surgery received an MRA. Among the 48 patients with bilateral lesions, surgery was performed for 1 patient (because of misinterpretation of the adre- nal venous sampling results), and the other patients received MRAs. The mean follow-up durations for the surgery and medical treatment groups were 3.8 years and 4.6 years, respectively. 
The patientsâ baseline characteristics according to their PA subtypes are shown in Table 1. Patients with unilateral lesions tended to be female and have lower BMI values, compared to patients with bilateral lesions. Patients with unilateral lesions also had higher blood pressure values and lower serum potassium 
levels, compared to patients with bilateral lesions. Both groups exhibited similar serum creatinine levels and estimated GFR (eGFR) values. Patients with uni- lateral lesions exhibited more severe PA, compared to patients with bilateral lesions. 
Table 2 shows the treatment outcomes according to surgical or medical treatment. The surgical treatment group was younger than the medical treatment group. Compared to the medical treatment group, the surgical treatment group exhibited higher rates of hypertension remission (54.9% vs. 14.3%, p < 0.001), hypertension improvement (78.2% vs. 55.6%, p < 0.001), and hypo- kalemia normalization (97.1% vs. 93.7%, p = 0.046). The post-treatment renal functions were similar for the two groups. 
We also analyzed the treatment outcomes among patients with unilateral aldosterone excess (Table 3). The surgical treatment group in patients with unilateral lesions exhibited advantages in remission of hyperten- sion without worsened renal function. However, both groups exhibited similar hypertension improvements. No significant differences in the amelioration of hyper- tension or hypokalemia normalization were observed when we compared the age-, sex-, and BMI-matched surgical and medical treatment subgroups. 
Among the patients with PA who were >60 years old, the surgical and medical treatment groups exhib- ited similar rates of hypertension improvement and hypokalemia normalization (71.4% vs. 56.5%, p = 0.243; 88.6% vs. 100%, p = 0.244, respectively). However, the surgery group exhibited a higher rate of hypertension remission, compared to the medi- cal treatment group (Table 4). Furthermore, the sur- gery group exhibited significantly impaired serum creatinine and eGFR values, compared to the medi- cal treatment group. When we further analyzed the outcomes among >60-year-old patients with unilat- eral PA lesions, we observed that the outcomes were similar to those among all patients with PA who were >60 years old (Supplemental Table 1). The patients with an initial eGFR of <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (sur- gery: 32 cases, medical treatment: 12 cases) did not exhibit treatment-specific differences in hypertension remission (31.2% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.895), hypertension improvement (71.9% vs. 75.0%, p = 0.836), or hypo- kalemia normalization (87.5% vs. 100%, p = 0.438). Three patients developed hyperkalemia after surgery, and no patients developed hyperkalemia after initiat- ing medical treatment (Table 4). 
In the medical treatment group (n = 63), patients with unilateral and bilateral lesions did not exhibit any differences in hypertension amelioration, hypokalemia normalization, or renal function. However, patients with bilateral lesions had higher serum potassium lev- els after medical treatment, compared to patients with unilateral lesions, which implied that medical treatment might be more effective for bilateral lesions (Table 5). 
Discussion 
The present study revealed that surgical treatment provided better hypertension and hypokalemia out- comes, compared to medical treatment, among all patients with PA or the subgroup of patients with uni- lateral PA. However, surgical treatment did not pro- vide a relative advantage in improving hypertension (vs. medical treatment) among patients who were >60 years old, although surgical treatment was more effec- tive in achieving hypertension remission. Furthermore, older patients exhibited worsened renal function after surgery, compared to after medical treatment. 
Previous studies have indicated that surgical treat- ment for PA provides better blood pressure and hypo- kalemia outcomes, compared to medical treatment 
[3, 6, 14-17]. For example, a recent Japanese epide- miological study [6] revealed that surgical treatment for patients with unilateral or bilateral PA was sig- nificantly associated with hypertension amelioration (odds ratio [OR]: 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.29â0.77) and hypokalemia normalization (OR: 0.17, 95% CI: 0.11â0.29), although medical treat- ment was not significantly related to the treatment outcomes. Other researchers have reported that the surgical treatment group exhibited a similar reduction in blood pressure and normalization of hypokalemia, compared to the medical treatment group [2, 8, 18]. Moreover, a recent systemic review revealed that sur- gery for unilateral aldosterone excess provided nor- malization of blood pressure (42% of patients) and hypokalemia (96â100% of patients) [10], which are similar to our findings. However, surgery was not suf- ficient for achieving blood pressure control in patients with long-term aldosterone excess and end-organ damage [19]. A long-term retrospective cohort study also revealed that approximately 70% of patients with unilateral lesions required additional antihypertensive treatment after surgery [13], and up to 10% of patients experienced surgery-related complications (in addi- tion to the MRA side effects) [12]. 
Despite our imbalance in the groups with unilateral and bilateral aldosterone excess, we found that surgery provided better hypertension remission and hypokale- mia normalization (vs. medical treatment) among all patients with PA and the subgroup of patients with uni- lateral PA. However, the hypertension improvement rates were similar for surgical and medical treatment of unilateral aldosterone excess. Thus, MRA treatment for unilateral aldosterone excess provided less complete effects on the patientsâ blood pressure and biochemi- cal profile, compared to the surgical removal of APAs. However, we observed that patients who received medi- cal treatment were significantly older, compared to the surgery group. Nevertheless, when we created age-, sex-, and BMI-matched surgical and medical treatment subgroups, we found that both subgroups exhibited similar rates of hypertension remission. Furthermore, we assessed the medical treatment outcomes among patients with unilateral or bilateral lesions, and found similar blood pressure and renal outcomes in the two groups. However, patients with medically treated unilat- eral lesions are inevitably older compared with patients with medically treated bilateral lesions, and these find- ings imply that age affects treatment outcomes. 
Our previous study revealed that older age was sig- nificantly associated with postoperative hyperkalemia [20], and other studies have also reported that older age predicted persistent postoperative hypertension and impaired renal function [9, 12]. Thus, we re-analyzed the treatments among patients with PA who were >60 years old (n = 58). In this subgroup, both treatments pro- vided similar rates of hypokalemia normalization, which conflicts with our findings among the entire group of patients with PA. However, >60-year-old patients exhib- ited a greater a decrease in eGFR after surgery, com- pared to after medical treatment, while both treatment groups exhibited similar eGFR levels for the entire pop- ulation of patients with APA. In addition, we found that patients with an initial eGFR of <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 did not experience any significant surgery-related benefits in hypertension remission, hypertension improvement, or hypokalemia normalization. Furthermore, a cost-benefit analysis has revealed that adrenalectomy is more cost-effective, compared to lifelong MRA treatment, if the patientâs life expectancy is >25 years [21]. Therefore, it appears that surgical and medical treatments for elderly patients may provide similar costs, and that med- ical treatment can be considered for elderly patients with PA, even if they have unilateral lesions. 
In the present study, the incidence of chronic kidney disease (eGFR of <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) increased after both surgical and medical treatment (surgery: from 15.6% to 31.2%, medical treatment: from 19.0% to 30.0%). Similarly, a 12-month prospective study of patients with PA revealed that the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (15.7% among 102 APA cases and 8.1% among bilateral adrenal hyperplasia cases) increased at the end of the study (to 37.1% and 28.3%, respectively; p < 0.001) [16]. In addition, the correction rates for glomerular hyperfiltration and microalbuminuria were similar among patients with PA who received MRAs or underwent adrenalectomy [4, 7]. However, we expe- rienced complications that were related to hypoaldo- steronism, which can contribute to glomerular hyper- filtration and volume retention, and subsequently lead to incorrectly low serum creatinine levels and overesti- mated eGFR values [22, 23]. Nevertheless, hypoaldo- steronism treatment increases serum creatinine levels and reduces the GFR, which is associated with post- treatment hyperkalemia [20]. 
To the best of our knowledge, only one study has directly compared the efficacy and safety of surgi- cal and medical treatments for patients with unilat- eral aldosterone excess. Catena et al. performed a pro- spective long-term study that compared spironolactone treatment and surgery among 54 patients with unilat- eral PA [8]. However, the authors did not detect a sig- nificant difference in the composite endpoint (myo- cardial infarction, coronary revascularization, stroke, or arrhythmia) after a mean follow-up duration of 7.4 years [8]. In contrast, Ghose et al. reported controlled blood pressure and normalized serum potassium con- centrations among 24 patients with APA who received medical treatment for â¥5 years, which led the authors to suggest that medical management can be a reason- able alternative to surgery [24]. However, that study did not directly compare the efficacy of medical and surgical treatments. Thus, unlike previous reports that compared surgical treatment for patients with unilateral aldosterone excess and medical treatment for patients with bilateral lesions, we directly compared the effi- cacy and safety of surgical and medical treatments for patients with only unilateral aldosterone excess. 
Our study has several limitations. First, we used a retrospective design, which is associated with a well-known risk of bias and the small sample size may attenuate the differences in treatment outcomes that we observed in the surgical and medical subgroup analysis. 
Second, we did not consider the potentially confound- ing effects of surgical complications, hospitalization, surgery-related pain, and quality of life. Third, we were unable to evaluate the effects of cardiovascular disease, based on the limited sample size, although pre- vious studies have reported that there was no cardio- vascular disease-related difference [10, 14]. Fourth, we only identified 1 patient who underwent surgery for bilateral aldosterone excess (because of a diagnostic mistake). Fifth, we did not compare the efficacy of sur- gical and medical treatments among patients with bilat- eral lesions. Sixth, eGFR measurements may not accu- rately assess renal function, as aldosterone excess is associated with glomerular hyperfiltration. However, we did not measure other renal outcome parameters, such as urinary albumin excretion. 
In conclusion, our results indicate that surgical treatment provided better hypertension and hypokale- mia outcomes, compared to medical treatment, among patients with unilateral aldosterone excess. However, older patients with PA exhibited greater postoperative decreases in renal function, compared to after medi- cal treatment, despite experiencing similar treatment outcomes. Thus, MRAs may be a useful alternative to surgery among elderly patients with PA and impaired renal function. "

Context
Studies find surgery superior to medications in the treatment of primary aldosteronism (PA). It would be ideal to compare surgical and medical therapy in patients with unilateral PA only, who have the option between these treatment modalities. However, this is challenging as most patients with unilateral PA on adrenal vein sampling (AVS) undergo surgery.
Objective
To compare outcomes of surgery and medications in patients with confirmed or likely unilateral PA.
Design
Retrospective cohort study of 274 patients with PA managed at two referral centres from 2000 to 2019.
Patients
154 patients identified with unilateral PA using AVS and a validated clinical prediction model were treated with surgical (n = 86) or medical (n = 68) therapy.
Measurements
Primary outcome was a composite incident cardiovascular event comprising acute myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, stroke, atrial fibrillation or congestive cardiac failure. Secondary outcomes were clinical and biochemical control.
Results
Cardiovascular outcomes were comparable, with the surgery group having an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.32â2.67), p = .89. Both treatments improved clinical and biochemical control, but surgery resulted in better systolic blood pressure, 133.0 Â± 11.7 mmHg versus 137.9 Â± 14.6 mmHg, p = .02, and lower defined daily dosages of antihypertensive medications, 1.0 (IQR 0.0â2.0) versus 2.6 (IQR 0.8â4.3), p < .001. In addition, 12 of 86 patients in the surgery group failed medical therapy before opting for surgery.
Conclusion
In patients with unilateral PA who can tolerate medications, medical therapy improves clinical and biochemical control, and may offer similar cardiovascular protection. However, surgery reduces pill burden, may cure hypertension and is recommended for unilateral PA.
1 INTRODUCTION
Primary aldosteronism (PA) is likely the most common treatable cause of hypertension, afflicting 5%â20% of all patients with hypertension.1, 2 Patients with PA are at higher risk of myocardial infarctions, strokes and atrial fibrillation when compared to patients with essential hypertension at similar levels of blood pressure (BP).3, 4 This has been attributed to the direct deleterious effects of aldosterone.4, 5 Specific treatment of PA improves BP control and may ameliorate this excess cardiovascular risk.4, 5 While some studies have shown that medical or surgical therapy have similar benefits in terms of BP, cardiovascular and renal outcomes,5, 6 others have found surgery to be superior.7 Of note, a recent large retrospective study found that while surgery led to reduced cardiovascular events, patients treated with medical therapy had persistently elevated risk.8, 9 This suggests that surgery is a superior therapeutic option for patients with PA.
However, studies comparing surgical and medical therapy are often confounded by the fact that patients undergoing either treatment have two distinctly different underlying pathologies.4, 8, 10 Surgically treated patients have unilateral PA, while medically treated patients often have bilateral PA. While somatic mutations have been found in ~50% of adrenal tumours from patients with unilateral PA,11, 12 the mechanisms underpinning bilateral PA is still largely unknown. Since surgery can only be considered in unilateral PA, it would be more appropriate to compare the outcomes of surgery versus medical therapy in only patients with unilateral PA. However, this direct comparison is challenging. Prior to surgery, almost all patients with PA are required to undergo an invasive adrenal vein sampling (AVS) to confirm unilateral disease. AVS is not necessary if patients are not keen for surgery. Hence, the majority of patients with confirmed unilateral PA after AVS opt for surgery instead of medical therapy, making such a comparison between the two modalities difficult. Meanwhile, many patients on medical therapy without a prior AVS result may have underlying unilateral disease. These patients form an ideal comparison cohort. Therefore, we adopted a novel approach of applying a recently validated prediction score that our group had developed, to identify these patients with unilateral PA.
This clinical prediction score, the aldosteroneâpotassium ratio (APR), was recently developed in our Asian cohort and validated externally in a European cohort. It was highly accurate in differentiating patients with unilateral PA from those with bilateral PA,13 with an area under receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.70â0.89). APR is calculated using the baseline aldosterone (ng/dl) divided by lowest-recorded potassium, and patients with elevated APR are more likely to have unilateral PA. Hence, we applied our prediction score to patients without a formal AVS result, to identify those with likely unilateral PA, in addition to those identified by lateralization on AVS. Subsequent analyses were performed to compare the outcomes between surgical and medical therapy for these patients with unilateral PA.
2 METHODS
We conducted a large retrospective analysis of 274 patients managed for PA at two major referral centres in Singapore from 2000 to 2019. Local ethics approval was obtained. This observational retrospective study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04428827). Baseline clinical data were obtained from patient medical records as previously described,13and all patients included in our study fulfilled the diagnostic criteria recommended by the Endocrine Society guidelines.14 Details on diagnostic testing are available in Data S1. We excluded patients without adequate follow-up data for at least 6 months post-treatment, as well as those with baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <45 ml/min/1.73 m2because they are less suitable surgical candidates. The defined daily dose (DDD) of antihypertensive medications was recorded (https:/www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/). Hyperlipidemia was defined as LDL cholesterol levels â¥4.1 mmol/L, HDL <1.0 mmol/L, triglycerides â¥2.0 mmol/L, or on current medical treatment for hyperlipidemia.15
We had developed a clinical prediction score, APR, to predict unilateral PA in our Asian cohort and validated this in a European cohort, utilizing only patients with a successful AVS.13 A high APR was predictive of unilateral disease, with an 84.4% probability in those with APR >10, and 91.7% in those with APR >15. Hence, we applied this score to patients with indeterminate subtype (either did not undergo or failed AVS). Patients with either confirmed unilateral disease on AVS, or those with APR >10, were included for analysis (Figure 1).
Derivation of study cohort. 274 patients managed for primary aldosteronism at two referral centres. 154 patients were identified with unilateral disease by either adrenal vein sampling or clinical prediction score and managed with medical (N = 68) or surgical (N = 86) therapy. AVS, adrenal vein sampling; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; PA, primary aldosteronism
2.1 Outcome
Baseline BP was taken prior to treatment and was calculated as the average of two BP readings taken in an ambulatory clinic setting after 5 minutes of rest. Patients were treated with either surgical (unilateral adrenalectomy) or medical (spironolactone, eplerenone, or amiloride) therapy. Systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), potassium and creatinine measurements were recorded for all patients after commencing treatment at 6 months, 1 year and yearly thereafter until their final visit. Use of antihypertensive medications was recorded at baseline, 6 months and at the final visit. The final visit was taken as the last known clinic visit or the censure date (30 September 2017 or 30 December 2019 for patients recruited after 2017), whichever was earlier.
Our primary outcome was an incident cardiovascular event defined as a composite of acute myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization or coronary artery bypass graft, admission for congestive cardiac failure, incident atrial fibrillation or stroke. Covariates for the cardiovascular outcomes that were considered as potential confounders were as follows: age, gender, ethnicity, duration of hypertension, history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, smoking, BMI, baseline eGFR, SBP and DBP, history of cardiovascular disease (composite of previous acute myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization or coronary artery bypass graft, admission for congestive cardiac failure, atrial fibrillation or stroke). Ascertainment of cardiovascular events was determined independently by two investigators (WL and MZ) masked to the patient's treatment modality of PA.
Secondary outcomes included BP, antihypertensive medication use and serum potassium after treatment for PA. In patients treated with surgery, patients were assessed postoperatively for clinical and biochemical response using the Primary Aldosteronism Surgical Outcome (PASO) criteria.16 Patients on medical therapy with renin measurements done were determined to be either unsuppressed (â¥1 ng/ml/h), or persistent suppressed (<1 ng/ml/h).
2.2 Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as mean (SD) and compared using independent t test or median (IQR) and compared using MannâWhitney test as appropriate. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square test. Our primary analysis investigated the risk for incident cardiovascular events between patients managed with surgical therapy compared with patients on medical therapy. We used adjusted Cox regression models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Patients were censored on the date of the specific outcome occurrence, or the final visit date if outcome did not occur. For secondary analyses investigating the change in BP, we used repeated measures models to compare the difference in BP between patients managed with surgical or medical therapy. For secondary analyses investigating the change in antihypertensive medications and serum potassium from baseline to final visit, paired t test was used. All tests for significance and resulting p values were 2-sided, with a level of significance of 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 25, IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA.
3 RESULTS
3.1 Baseline characteristics
For the study cohort, 274 patients with PA were managed at two major referral centres from 2000 to 2019 (Figure 1). 82 patients were confirmed with unilateral PA after a successful AVS. 150 patients with indeterminate subtype were stratified using the clinical prediction score (APR), of which 94 patients were identified as having likely unilateral disease. We excluded 17 patients who did not receive treatment or had inadequate follow-up data, five patients with baseline eGFR <45 ml/min/1.73 m2, and one patient with persistent hypokalemia post-surgery who was started on mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist. 154 patients with either confirmed or likely unilateral PA were included in our study cohort, mean age 52.9 Â± 9.8 years, and 59 (38.3%) females. 68 patients were treated with medications, and 86 patients underwent surgery. Twelve patients who were initially on medical therapy but subsequently opted for surgery in view of medication side effects or patient preference were classified in the surgery group. At baseline, compared to the group receiving medical therapy, patients treated with surgery were younger, had a higher eGFR and were more likely to harbour a unilateral adrenal adenoma (Table 1). Otherwise, the groups had similar baseline SBP, DBP, use of antihypertensive medications and hormone levels. At baseline, the prevalence of ischaemic heart disease, stroke and atrial fibrillation was similar in both groups. 10 (14.7%) patients in the medical group and 14 (16.3%) patients in the surgical group had at least one cardiovascular disease, p = .79.

3.2 BP and biochemical outcomes
The mean duration of follow-up was 5.7 Â± 4.5 years. After treatment, there was an improvement in SBP and DBP in both groups (Figure 2, and Table S1). The average post-treatment SBP was lower in the surgical group compared to medical group, 133.0 vs 137.9 mmHg, p = .021, while the post-treatment DBP was similar at 79.8 versus 80.4 mmHg, p = .68 (Table 2). On repeated measures, SBP in surgical group was significantly lower as compared to medical group (mean difference _3.6 mmHg [95% CI _6.7 to _0.5], p = .023), while DBP in surgical group was similar to medical group (mean difference _0.7 mmHg [95% CI _1.2 to 2.6], p = .45). There was also an overall trend of reduction in SBP (p < .001) and DBP over time (p < .001), with both groups showing a similar trend. The improved BP was attained with fewer antihypertensive medications in the surgical group compared to medical group, DDD of 1.0 (0.0â2.0) versus 2.6 (0.8â4.3), p < .001 and number of medications 1.0 (0.0â2.0) versus 2.0 (1.0â3.0), p < .001. Final potassium levels were higher in the surgical group compared to medical group, 4.4 versus 4.1 mmol/L, p = .005.

3.3 Renin suppression and PASO criteria
Final aldosterone levels were expectedly lower in patients treated with surgery (Table 2). Post-treatment renin levels were similar in both groups, with 10 of 16 patients (62.5%) after medical therapy and 34 of 55 (61.8%) after surgery having a plasma renin activity above 1.0 ng/ml/h Patients treated with surgery were assessed using the PASO criteria which showed 29.1% having complete clinical success, 52.3% partial clinical success and 18.6% absent clinical success. All 86 patients (100%) had complete resolution of hypokalaemia. 91.1% had complete biochemical success, 7.1% had partial biochemical success and 1.8% had absent biochemical success (Table S2).
3.4 Cardiovascular outcome
In total, there were 27 events in 20 patients at the end of follow-up, with ten acute myocardial infarctions or revascularizations, ten incident atrial fibrillation, seven strokes and no admissions for congestive cardiac failure. The unadjusted HR for the composite cardiovascular outcome for patients treated surgically was 0.59 (95% CI 0.24â1.45), p = .24. After taking into account the covariates, adjusted HR was 0.93, (95% CI 0.32â2.67), p = .89 (Figure 3). The other variables that were still significant for increased cardiovascular events were duration of hypertension, HR 1.09 (95% CI 1.01â1.18), p = .027, and history of smoking, HR 7.89 (95% CI 1.54â40.29), p = .013. In a subgroup analysis of patients who underwent surgery, we compared 52 patients who had lateralisation on AVS, versus 34 patients who underwent adrenalectomy based only on CT findings of a unilateral adenoma. There were no difference in final BP or use of antihypertensive medications and similar proportions of patients with complete clinical success (Table S3). There was a higher proportion of patients who underwent surgery based on CT findings with absent clinical success. All patients had complete resolution of hypokalaemia, and there was no difference in biochemical success outcomes. We analysed for cardiovascular outcomes after including only AVS-identified adrenalectomy patients and the adjusted HR was 1.003 (95% CI: 0.259â3.888), p = .997 (Figure S1). We performed another subgroup analysis while including only patients with a higher APR of >15. This provided more specificity, and patients with APR >15 had a likelihood of unilateral PA of 91.7%. 112 patients were included for analysis, and the adjusted HR was 0.91 (0.23â3.60), p = .90.
4 DISCUSSION
We found that in patients with confirmed or likely unilateral PA, both surgical and medical therapy improved BP and biochemical control, with similar cardiovascular outcomes. However, surgery led to better BP control with lower requirement of antihypertensive medications. There have been conflicting reports on the efficacy of surgical and medical therapy,3, 4, 17 but most have found superiority with surgery.8, 18 Since the options of surgical or medical therapy are mainly for patients with unilateral disease, it is more relevant to restrict this comparison to patients with unilateral PA. A previous study19 found better BP and potassium control with surgery amongst patients after 6 months of treatment. We have added to those findings by demonstrating that BP control continues to improve beyond the first 6 months. In addition, the cardiovascular risk in both treatment groups was ameliorated to a similar extent, highlighting the importance of timely diagnosis of PA and appropriate treatment of PA with MR antagonists.
Aldosterone excess has direct deleterious effects independent of BP, which leads to left ventricular hypertrophy,6 cardiovascular events, arrhythmias and stroke.3 Hence, appropriate treatment with surgery or MR antagonists is important to correct this in patients with PA,4, 10 as well as those with secondary hyperaldosteronism.20 While surgery leads to more immediate left ventricular regression post-treatment, the benefit of medical therapy appears to be similar after some time.6 We found that the composite risk of cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, arrhythmias and strokes was similar with surgical and medical therapy. Our findings differ from Hundemer and colleagues8, 21 who found that patients with PA on medical therapy were still at increased risk of cardiovascular events, whereas excess risk was ameliorated after surgery. There could be several reasons for this. We included only patients with unilateral PA, whereas Hundemer included all patients with PA, with only 16% of patients having unilateral disease. Patients with unilateral PA generally have a more severe phenotype and higher baseline aldosterone levels. Since patients with higher baseline aldosterone levels are also known to have greater response to treatment,22this may explain the greater improvement seen in our cohort. In addition, we used higher doses of MR antagonists, with spironolactone at 64 Â± 54 mg/day and eplerenone at 108 Â± 80 mg/day compared to the previous study, spironolactone at 42 Â± 28 mg/day, and eplerenone at 52 Â± 26 mg/day. Finally, Hundemer and colleagues found that the excess cardiovascular risk in patients with PA was ameliorated in those whose renin levels became unsuppressed, suggesting that adequate MR blockade is important. A greater proportion of our patients (10 of 16, 62.5%) on medical therapy had renin levels above 1 ng/ml/h, compared to only 33.3% in the earlier study. Furthermore, in the six patients with persistently suppressed renin, three were on beta blocker therapy which may account for renin suppression. However, we note that similar to the previous study, only a minority of our patients on medical therapy had renin measurements (24% vs. 33%).
We found that surgery led to better SBP control and higher potassium levels compared to medical therapy and continued improvements in BP were noted after the initial 6 months. For patients on medical therapy, this may be due to medications being started at a low dose and titrated upwards subsequently. Expectedly, use of antihypertensive medications after treatment was lower in the surgery group compared to medical group. This supports a recent large multi-centre real world study, AVIS-2 (Adrenal Vein Sampling International Study 2), which demonstrated better clinical and biochemical control, and lower requirement of antihypertensive medications in patients treated with surgery,18 highlighting the importance of subtyping patients with PA.
Surgery offers additional benefits to medications, which includes the possibility of cure of hypertension, seen in 30%â60% of patients. This is more common in patients who are younger, female, with a shorter duration of hypertension and requiring fewer antihypertensive medications.23, 24 Even in patients who are not cured of hypertension, there is a marked improvement of BP along with reduction in pill burden of antihypertensive medications. MR antagonists can lead to various side effects that affect quality of life (QOL). In support of this, a recent large prospective study found that the QOL of patients with PA treated with surgery improved to normal population-adjusted values.25 Although QOL in patients treated with medications did improve, they did not return to normal values, and this disparity in QOL was associated with the use of antihypertensive medications. In the long-term, surgery is also more cost-effective, as patients require fewer medications and less frequent clinic visits.26 Finally, in addition to QOL and cardiovascular disease, surgery may also bring about superior renal5, 9 and metabolic27 outcomes.
Although surgery resulted in greater improvement of SBP compared to medications, both treatments had similar reduction in cardiovascular risk. There could be several reasons for this. Firstly, although surgery led to a greater reduction of SBP by 3.8 mmHg compared to medications, both groups had marked improvements in SBP and DBP (16 and 5 mmHg respectively). Secondly, the proportion of patients with controlled BP after treatment were similar in both groups. Finally, this finding is also in keeping with our current understanding that MR antagonism is crucial in ameliorating risk in patients with PA and suggests that MR antagonism is just as important as BP control.3 Interestingly, in our patients on medical therapy, an improved BP was achieved with no change in total DDD of antihypertensive medications after switching to MR antagonists. In a previous report on 24 patients with unilateral disease on long-term medical therapy, there was also a robust response to medications, with a low rate of cardiovascular events.28 This further highlights that MR antagonists work mechanistically in PA, providing greater BP control than other medications, and reinforces the importance of improving the case detection and treatment of PA worldwide.
The differences in outcomes between surgery and medical therapy observed by previous studies may also be due to inherent differences between PA subtypes. Somatic mutations of KCNJ5, ATP1A1, ATP2B3, CACNA1D and CTNNB111, 12 have been found in at least half, and up to 88%29 of aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs) removed during unilateral adrenalectomy. However, the underlying pathophysiology of bilateral PA remains largely unknown as these patients do not undergo surgery. Recently, autopsy studies have found an increase in prevalence of aldosterone-producing cell clusters (APCCs) with age.30 These APCCs occasionally harbour similar ATP and calcium channel mutations to APAs, but not KCNJ5 mutations which are the most frequent mutation found in APAs. This suggests that the underlying mutations driving bilateral PA may differ fundamentally from unilateral PA. Another possible reason for the difference in outcome could be that patients with bilateral PA may have a greater autonomous cortisol secretion which may not be adequately addressed with MR antagonist therapy alone.31 While patients with unilateral PA have a choice between surgical or medical therapy, surgery is not routinely offered to patients with bilateral PA unless there are special considerations such as severe resistant hypertension.32Furthermore, the efficacy of medical therapy can be limited by suboptimal adherence to long-term medications and medication adverse effects. In 13.2% of our patients, MR antagonists had to be stopped in view of progressive renal disease or hyperkalaemia. In the future, use of functional imaging such as 11C-metomidate PET-CT,33 to identify the exact site of aldosterone excess, coupled with newer treatment modalities like radiofrequency ablation,34, 35 may potentially provide a treatment pathway for bilateral adrenal nodules. Nevertheless, this may not be possible for patients with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia.
We acknowledge several limitations in our study. Firstly, not all patients had undergone AVS to formally subtype their disease. However, most patients with lateralisation on AVS will undergo adrenalectomy, making it difficult to attain sufficient numbers of patients on medications, and also precluding the conduct of such a randomised controlled trial. By using a prediction score that was developed with this cohort of patients, which was externally validated, we were able to identify more patients with unilateral disease on medical therapy to allow for this comparison. Our results have to be taken in the context that the comparison was made in patients with both confirmed, as well as likely, unilateral PA. Secondly, we did not include patients with essential hypertension for comparison as that was not in line with our main objective. We intended to compare the cardiovascular risk between surgical and medical therapy, focussing on patients with unilateral PA. The event rate of cardiovascular disease was low in our study and comparable with rates seen in other cohorts of patients treated for PA4, 8 although direct comparisons cannot be made between cohorts. Thirdly, as a retrospective observational study, there was inherent selection bias as our patients had a choice of which therapy they preferred. Indeed, 12 patients underwent surgery despite initially taking MR antagonists, driven in part by adverse effects to medications. The tolerability of medications in patients with unilateral PA needs further study. Fourthly, only 29% of our patients were cured of hypertension after adrenalectomy. Rates of cure vary between centres, ranging from 17% to 62% in PASO study.16 It is likely that higher cure rates may portend better cardiovascular outcomes. Finally, there was a trend towards surgery being beneficial to medical therapy, and we cannot exclude the possibility that with a larger cohort and longer duration of follow-up, we might find that surgery may in fact lead to better outcomes. Indeed, in view of the importance and prevalence of PA, further validation should be done in larger cohort studies. We certainly do advocate that patients with unilateral PA amenable for surgery should seriously consider surgery as their first-line treatment.
5 CONCLUSION
We demonstrated that in patients with confirmed or likely unilateral PA, who are averse to surgery and are tolerant of medications, medical therapy may provide a viable treatment option. Medical therapy improves BP and biochemical control, and may offer similar cardiovascular protection. This underscores the importance of diagnosing PA and instituting targeted therapy with MR antagonists. Surgery should be the first-line treatment for unilateral PA as it reduces pill burden and offers the opportunity for cure of hypertension altogether."

Abstract
In comparison with essential hypertension, primary aldosteronism (PA) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity. To date, no data on mortality have been published. We assessed mortality of patients treated for PA within the German Conn's registry and identified risk factors for adverse outcome in a case-control study. Patients with confirmed PA treated in 3 university centers in Germany since 1994 were included in the analysis. All of the patients were contacted in 2009 and 2010 to verify life status. Subjects from the population-based F3 survey of the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg served as controls. Final analyses were based on 600 normotensive controls, 600 hypertensive controls, and 300 patients with PA. Kaplan-Meyer survival curves were calculated for both cohorts. Ten-year overall survival was 95% in normotensive controls, 90% in hypertensive controls, and 90% in patients with PA (P value not significant). In multivariate analysis, age (hazard ratio, 1.09 per year [95% CI, 1.03â1.14]), angina pectoris (hazard ratio, 3.6 [95% CI, 1.04â12.04]), and diabetes mellitus (hazard ratio, 2.55 [95% CI, 1.07â6.09]) were associated with an increase in all-cause mortality, whereas hypokalemia (hazard ratio, 0.41 per mmol/L [95% CI, 0.17â0.99]) was associated with reduced mortality. Cardiovascular mortality was the main cause of death in PA (50% versus 34% in hypertensive controls; P<0.05). These data indicate that cardiovascular mortality is increased in patients treated for PA, whereas all-cause mortality is not different from matched hypertensive controls.
Introduction
Aldosterone is a key regulator of fluid and electrolyte balance in human physiology. Aldosterone excess in the presence of a high-sodium diet raises blood pressure. High blood pressure, together with direct proinflammatory and profibrotic effects of aldosterone on the vessel wall, causes and sustains cardiovascular atherosclerosis.1,2 In keeping with these findings, high aldosterone levels are associated with mortality in heart failure cohorts,3 and blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by mineralocorticoid antagonists improves outcome in heart failure and after myocardial infarction.4,5 The contribution of aldosterone to the development of arterial hypertension in the general population has been suggested by the Framingham Offspring Study, in which plasma aldosterone levels in normotensive subjects predicted subsequent increases in blood pressure and the development of hypertension.6
Recent evidence suggests that primary aldosteronism (PA) is more common than previously thought.7 Several studies have provided evidence that patients with PA are especially prone to cardiovascular and renal complications. In a recent study by Catena et al,8 aldosterone excess caused left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction independent of blood pressure. Several studies have indicated a higher prevalence of cardiovascular events and stroke in PA in comparison with essential hypertension.9,10 Likewise, pronounced fibrosis of small resistance arteries was detected in a series of 13 patients with PA compared with blood pressureâmatched patients with essential hypertension.11 Overall, these examples provide evidence that PA needs to be detected early in the course of the disease and treated appropriately. Unilateral PA is generally treated by adrenalectomy, which provokes a major fall in blood pressure in >85% of patients and blood pressure normalization in 30% to 60%.12 A similar effect is observed in patients with idiopathic bilateral adrenal hyperplasia treated with the mineralocorticoid antagonist spironolactone.13Recently, a study demonstrated that either treatment reduced excess renal and cardiovascular morbidity to a level similar to that of matched essential hypertensives.14
No study has so far investigated mortality in PA. Based on the blood pressure response to adrenalectomy or mineralocorticoid antagonist treatment, it is reasonable to assume that long-term mortality may be equal to or even lower than that of matched hypertensive controls. On the other hand, the lag period between first symptoms of PA (hypertension) and final diagnosis ranges from 9 to 12 years.15,16 Therefore, aldosterone excess is typically long-standing, and the proinflammatory effects of aldosterone may have led to irreversible damage to the vascular wall, the myocardium, and the kidney, increasing long-term mortality despite initiation of specific treatment. The German Conn's Registry-Else KrÃ¶ner-Fresenius Hyperaldosteronism Registry was founded in 2006 and investigates disease-specific effects of PA on a broad range of outcome variables using a multicenter approach. In this study we analyzed all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in a cohort of 337 patients with PA compared with a cohort of control subjects with and without hypertension.
Methods
Description of the Registry, Study Population
The German Conn's Registry (www.conn-register.de) is a multicenter database analyzing comorbidities and long-term outcomes of patients with PA.16â18 Since the start of the prospective phase of the registry in 2008, all patients actively treated within the centers are entered in a common database.19 For this study, the patients of the 3 largest German centers (Berlin, n=55; WÃ¼rzburg, n=102; Munich, n=180) treated between 1994 and 2010 were included in the analysis. The ethics committees of the University of Munich and of the participating centers approved the protocol. Data protection laws were strictly adhered to.
Clinical data at time of diagnosis were extracted from patient charts, including laboratory test results, initiation of mineralocorticoid antagonist treatment, surgical treatment, cardiovascular comorbidities, body mass index (BMI), and metabolic conditions, such as diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia. In case of multiple determinations, the measurements of potassium, plasma renin activity or concentration, and aldosterone at first presentation were used for statistical calculations. Blood was generally drawn in the fasting state, although this was not standardized within centers.
The diagnostic criteria for PA in this study followed those of the Endocrine Society Practice guidelines.20 All of the patients included had an elevated aldosterone:renin ratio and an abnormal confirmatory test (acute volume loading, furosemide test, fludrocortisone suppression test, or captopril test)16,17 and/or had confirmation of PA by demonstration of elevated excretion of aldosterone and its metabolites in urine. Adjustment of medication before screening was performed as feasible, with _-blockers withdrawn for 1 week and mineralocorticoid antagonists for 4 weeks. The diagnosis of PA was centrally verified by review of all of the available data. A total of 337 patients with confirmed PA from the German Conn's Registry for whom sufficient data coverage was available were included in the final analysis. Subtype differentiation between aldosterone-producing adenoma and bilateral adrenal hyperplasia was based on adrenal imaging (computed tomography or MRI). In addition, adrenal vein sampling was performed in 36% (Berlin), 59% (WÃ¼rzburg), and 21% (Munich) of patients, respectively, until 2007 and in 54%, 66%, and 87%, thereafter.21 Unilateral adrenalectomy was performed in 157 of 337 patients (47%) for suspected unilateral aldosterone excess, mainly aldosterone-producing adenoma. The remaining patients were treated with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.
In 2009 and 2010, patients were contacted both by mail and telephone. In the case of nonresponse, the registration office, the health insurance, or the treating physician was contacted to retrieve information regarding the life status of the patient. In deceased patients, the cause of death was verified by death certificates and hospital records whenever possible using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision.22
Control Population
The Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) F3 survey23 was performed in 2004 and represents a follow-up study of the population-based KORA S3 study. The S3 survey conducted in 1994/1995 was based on a random sampled of German residents of the Augsburg region aged 25 to 74 years identified through the public record office. For the purpose of the present study, 2835 normotensive and 2021 hypertensive subjects from the S3 survey were enrolled. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure â¥140/90 mmHg and/or current use of antihypertensive drugs, given that the subjects were aware of being hypertensive.
More than 99.5% of the participants were white. The high standard of the World Health Organization Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease project applies to the survey. In 2004/2005, all of the study participants underwent a re-examination including a standardized interview, a physical examination, and nonfasting blood sampling by trained staff. Participants gave informed written consent on a form approved by the ethics committee of the Bavarian state board of physicians. The life status of all of the subjects was assessed in 2004/2005 and again in 2008/2009. Death certificates with exact date of death were obtained from local health departments and coded for the underlying cause of death by a single trained person.
Definitions
Diabetes mellitus was defined as a known history of diabetes mellitus at the time of first investigation of PA. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as total cholesterol >200 mg/dL and hypertriglyceridemia as total triglycerides >180 mg/dL. Overweight was defined as a BMI >25 kg/m2. Cardiovascular events were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision.
Statistics
Results are expressed as meanÂ±1 SD for normally distributed data and as median plus range in nonnormally distributed data, if not stated otherwise. A P value <0.05 was considered as significant. Matching between patients with PA and subjects from the KORA F3 survey was performed in a 1:2 fashion using age, sex, and BMI as matching variables, leading to a match in 300 patients and 600 normotensive and 600 hypertensive controls. Patients <30 years of age were excluded from the PA group for lack of counterparts in KORA. In addition, we matched for age, sex, and blood pressure using best-fit matching. Maximum matching variability for age was 5 years and for BMI 2 kg/m2. To increase the number of matches, a BMI mismatch of >2 kg/m2 was accepted in <1% of cases. Significance of differences was analyzed by t test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test with continuity correction, Fisher exact test, and McNemar _2 test with continuity correction, as appropriate. Kaplan-Meier plots were calculated to estimate the survival curves of PA patients and hypertensive controls (time of diagnosis to last contact or death in PA; date of survey to life status assessment/death in controls). Analyzing survival curves we used Cox regression and, if appropriate, also log-rank test. Cox regression was also used for regression analysis with multiple parameters to identify risk factors associated with death at the time of diagnosis. Potential risk factors were identified by manual backward elimination. Age, sex, BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure at first presentation, prevalent diabetes mellitus, lipid and potassium concentrations, plasma aldosterone and renin concentrations, and adrenalectomy were used for the initial model. All of the statistical analyses were carried out using R version 2.6.2 software.24
Results
Clinical Characteristics of the Study Populations
Clinical characteristics of the study populations are summarized in Table S1, available in the online-only Data Supplement. As expected, the cohorts differed in multiple variables.
Mortality in the Case-Control Study
Using age, sex, and BMI as matching variables, a case-control study of 300 patients with PA and 600 normotensive and 600 hypertensive controls was performed (for clinical characteristics, see Table 1), and Kaplan-Meier survival plots were calculated. Controls had higher triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations (probably because of the nonfasting state), lower blood pressure levels, and less frequently diabetes mellitus. Plasma potassium, plasma aldosterone, and plasma renin levels were unavailable in the control cohort.
Despite clinical and metabolic differences, 5- and 10-year overall survival of patients with PA (96% and 90%, respectively) was similar to that of hypertensive controls (95% and 90%, log rank test, not significant) and not significantly different from normotensive control (98% and 95%, not significant; Figure 1). We also matched in a separate approach for systolic blood pressure (in addition to age and sex) to take blood pressure as one of the most important determinants of cardiovascular mortality into account. This decreased the number of matches to 288 (based on a 1:1 matching of patients with hypertensive controls) but did not change all-cause mortality, which remained comparable in the cohorts (Table S2 and Figure S1).
Table 2 provides causes of death for PA patients and controls according to International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, classification. Cardiovascular causes were the main cause of death in the cohorts but were more frequent in PA than in controls (50% versus 34% in hypertensive controls [P<0.05%] versus 38% in normotensive controls). Assuming that two thirds of the unknown causes of death are attributable to cardiovascular death, the differences to hypertensives and normotensives are highly significant (P=0.004 and 0.02, respectively).
Causes and Risk Factors Associated With Mortality in PA
Hazard ratios (HRs) for variables likely associated with adverse outcome in PA were calculated. In univariate analysis, age, diabetes mellitus, and angina pectoris were associated with increased all-cause mortality (Table 3). Conversely, adrenalectomy (as compared with medical treatment of PA) was associated with reduced all-cause mortality and proved to be protective. Initial plasma aldosterone, plasma renin levels, initial blood pressure, and lipid concentrations had no significant effect on all-cause mortality. In a multivariate model, age (HR, 1.09 per year [95% CI] 1.03â1.14), angina pectoris (HR, 3.6 [95% CI. 1.04â12.4), and diabetes mellitus (HR, 2.55 [95% CI, 1.07â6.09]) were associated with an increase in mortality, whereas the presence of hypokalemia (HR, 0.41 per mmol/L [95% CI, 0.17â0.99]) was associated with a reduced mortality (Figure S2). This latter finding might be explained by a higher likelihood of aldosterone-producing adenoma and, consequently, adrenalectomy in severely hypokalemic PA patients (odds ratio, 1.9 [Fisher exact test] P<0.01).
Using age >50 years. diabetes mellitus. and angina pectoris as risk parameters, we developed a model with a scoring system of 0 to 3 points. As given in Figure 2, patients with PA with a score of â¥2 had an increased mortality rate that becomes evident â¥6 years after diagnosis.
Discussion
Using data of the German Conn's Registry and a German control cohort of subjects from a population-based survey, we investigated long-term mortality of treated PA in Germany. By combining the data of 3 centers, we collected a total of 337 patients with confirmed PA. After matching for age, sex, BMI, or blood pressure, our data show that all-cause mortality in patients with PA is not significantly different from that of hypertensive controls. These data are in accordance with the hypothesis that treatment of PA by adrenalectomy or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist medication reduces increased morbidity of untreated PA,14 thereby reducing overall mortality. However, beyond 10 years of follow-up, mortality in PA patients appears to be higher than in hypertensive controls, but the number of patients is too low to reach statistical significance.
We matched the cohorts using confounders of mortality as matching variables, such as age, sex, BMI, or blood pressure. Nevertheless, the cohorts remained unbalanced for important variables, such as diabetes mellitus and plasma lipids (Tables 1 and S2). Patients with PA had initially a much higher diabetes mellitus prevalence than controls (14% versus 7%), a finding reported previously.18 In contrast, control subjects had significantly higher total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels and lower high-density lipoprotein levels, which might be at least in part explained by the nonfasting status of the KORA F3 subjects.
Numerous studies have shown that patients with PA have an increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity. In comparison with blood pressureâmatched hypertensive controls without aldosterone excess, patients with PA have increased left ventricular mass and more severely impaired diastolic relaxation.8,25 This finding argues for aldosterone-specific effects on left ventricular function independent of blood pressure. Aldosterone excess results in glomerular hyperfiltration and microalbuminuria26 and, after a prolonged period of time, in loss of glomerular function.16 PA causes atherosclerotic changes in resistance arteries in fat biopsies.11 Patients with PA have an increased risk of cerebrovascular events10and are more likely to experience atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction.10,14 Patients with PA have increased left ventricular wall thicknesses and reduced diastolic function even in the absence of arterial hypertension, as shown by Stowasser et al26 in familial hyperaldosteronism type 1. In summary, these data support the concept that aldosterone excess is detrimental not only through increased blood pressure and hypokalemia but also through blood pressure independent proinflammatory and profibrotic effects on the heart and vessel wall.
Longitudinal studies by Catena et al14 and Sechi et al27 have shown that unfavorable effects of aldosterone excess can be ameliorated by adrenalectomy and mineralocorticoid antagonist treatment, respectively. Microalbuminuria, although much more prevalent in PA, is reversed to a similar degree as in hypertensive controls treated conventionally with antihypertensive drugs. In addition, disease control by targeted treatment reduces the cardiovascular risk to a degree comparable to that of patients with primary hypertension. In this setting, magnetic resonance angiogram treatment seems to be similarly effective as adrenalectomy. Up to this point, no study had reported mortality data in PA. Our study shows that overall mortality after diagnosis of PA and initiation of specific treatment is similar to that of matched hypertensive controls. A detailed analysis of the causes of death indicates that 50% of all-cause mortality (and 69% of known mortality) is attributable to cardiovascular mortality.
As summarized in Table 3, a number of factors were associated with increased mortality in the presence of aldosterone excess. These include age, diabetes mellitus, and angina pectoris. It might be surprising that, in this context, a variable such as blood pressure is not associated with increased mortality. However, it is reasonable to assume that our study is underpowered to detect a significant effect of this variable. A separate analysis including all 4856 KORA F3 subjects shows that blood pressure is indeed a highly significant predictor (P=0.003) of all-cause mortality (data not shown). Protective factors identified in our cohort were intervention by adrenalectomy and the presence of hypokalemia at diagnosis. The latter might be seen as an unexpected finding. Severe hypokalemia is an indirect measure of the level of aldosterone excess. Therefore, one might assume that severe hypokalemia can be detrimental in PA, increasing long-term mortality. However, 3 reasons may explain a favorable outcome with hypokalemia. First, the improved survival associated with severe hypokalemia may reflect earlier case detection of PA leading to more rapid treatment. Second, pronounced hypokalemia is frequently found in aldosterone-producing adenoma. Evidently more patients with severe hypokalemia had aldosterone-producing adenoma leading to a higher rate of adrenalectomy and possibly a better long-term control of blood pressure. Although the former is supported by the improved survival in PA patients undergoing adrenalectomy, the latter remains speculative because we cannot provide sufficient data of interim blood pressure measurements after adrenalectomy or spironolactone treatment. Third, an additional reason might be the more rapid therapeutic effect of adrenalectomy, which was shown for cardiac hypertrophy in PA patients.14 Along the same line, 2 studies showed that preoperative potassium levels are predictors of blood pressure control after adrenalectomy.28,29
Based on age, diabetes mellitus, and angina pectoris, which remained significant in a multivariate model, we calculated a sum score associated with an adverse outcome. As shown in Figure 2, patients with a score of â¥2 had an increased risk for death. The survival curves start to separate after 6 years of follow-up. These data suggest a lag period of several years until mortality increases in high-risk subjects, and long-term surveillance might be indicated accordingly. We believe that cardiovascular risk factors should be controlled tightly in patients who remain hypertensive after adrenalectomy or do not fully respond to mineralocorticoid antagonist therapy.
Limitations and Strengths of the Study
The strengths of our study are the large sample size of the PA cohort, the long period of follow-up, and the large hypertensive control cohort allowing a 2:1 matching. The limitations include the retrospective design of the analysis. For example, it is impossible to control for the intensity with which cardiovascular risk factors were managed in the PA subjects who were managed by hypertension specialists versus the matched subjects presumably managed by nonspecialists. Regression variables, such as blood pressure or diabetes mellitus, are entered into the model based on a single baseline measure but will have improved over time because of treatment effects. The magnitude of this effect could not be assessed in the present study. The control cohort was drawn from a population-based study and not from a patient cohort collected under similar conditions. Although subjects with PA were not excluded from our control cohort, we have reported previously that the prevalence of an elevated aldosterone:renin ratio in population-based cohorts is <5.1%.30 Furthermore, because of the high prevalence of essential hypertension, it is likely that, in a subgroup of our patients from our PA cohort, a component of essential hypertension was also present, indicating that a small overlap of diagnosis is virtually unavoidable in such an analysis.
In conclusion, our data show that all-cause mortality in patients with PA is similar to that of matched control hypertensives. PA patients at higher age and with coexisting conditions such as diabetes mellitus or angina pectoris are at higher risk and should be followed more closely in clinical practice.
Perspectives
PA is associated with increased cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity in excess to what might be expected from elevated blood pressure. This has been attributed to additive direct effects of aldosterone on the endothelium and the myocardium. Our study provides for the first time long-term data on mortality in PA. Mortality rates of treated patients with PA proved to be not different from those of matched hypertensives. Depending on the perspective, one might see the glass half-full (at least similar mortality rate to matched hypertensives) or half empty (a lower mortality rate might have been expected because of the often well-controlled blood pressure levels after initiation of specific treatment for PA). In the future, earlier detection of PA and more intensive blood pressure management after diagnosis hold the promise of a better outcome than shown in our study."

Abstract
Objective
Long-term outcomes (especially mortality and/or major cardiovascular events (MACE)) of the unilateral primary aldosteronism (uPA) patients who underwent medical or surgery-targeted treatment, relative to those with essential hypertension (EH), have been scarcely reported.
Design and settings
Using the prospectively designed observational Taiwan Primary Aldosteronism Investigation cohort, we identified 858 uPA cases among 1220 primary aldosteronism patients and another 1210 EH controls.
Exposures
Operated uPA patients were grouped via their 1-year post-therapy statuses.
Results
Primary Aldosteronism Surgical Outcome clinical complete success (hypertension remission) was achieved in 272 (49.9%) of 545 surgically treated uPA patients. After follow-up for 6.3 Â± 4.0 years, both hypertension-remissive (hazard ratio (HR): 0.54; P_ < 0.001) and not-cured (HR: 0.61; P_ < 0.001) uPA patients showed a lower risk of all-cause mortality than that of EH controls; whereas the not-cured group had a higher risk of incident MACE (sub-hazard ratio (sHR), 1.41; P_=_0.037) but similar atrial fibrillation (Af) and congestive heart failure (CHF). Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA)-treated uPA patients had higher risks of MACE (sHR: 1.38; P_=_0.033), Af (sHR:1.62, P_=_0.049), and CHF (sHR: 1.44; P_=_0.048) than those of EH controls, with mortality as a competing risk. Using inverse probability of treatment-weighted matching and counting adrenalectomy as a time-varying factor, treatment with adrenalectomy was associated with lower risks of all-cause mortality (HR: 0.57; P_=_0.035), MACE (HR: 0.67; P_=_0.037), and CHF (HR: 0.49; P_=_0.005) compared to those of MRA therapy.
Conclusions
Adrenalectomy, independent of post-surgical hypertension remission, was associated with lower all-cause mortality of uPA patients, compared to that of EH patients. We further documented a more beneficial effect of adrenalectomy over MRA treatment on long-term mortality, MACE, and CHF in uPA patients.
Introduction
Although the role of primary aldosteronism (PA) in increasing cardiovascular risks is well-known, along with the potential of targeted therapies for PA (1, 2), it is still unclear whether pharmacological or surgical-targeted treatment (3) for unilateral PA (uPA) patients could yield better complete hypertension remission, as defined by recent Primary Aldosteronism Surgical Outcome (PASO) criteria (4). Furthermore, which PASO status could be translated into lower risks of long-term mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and/or other cardiac outcomes remains unknown (5).
A systematic review indicated that clinical outcomes were similar in PA patients treated with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) or adrenalectomy (6). However, since patients with idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia (IHA) bear significantly different genotypes and heterogeneous phenotypic characteristics compared to uPA patients (7), optimal treatment options for uPA patients to achieve better long-term outcomes remain unknown.
A long-term research registry cohort reported higher risks of cardiometabolic events and death among PA patients after MRA treatment (non-surgical group) than their essential hypertension (EH) counterparts (8). Yet, in another cohort of PA patients, surgical or medical treatment had long-term cardiovascular outcomes comparable to EH controls (9). While we have shown via subgroup analyses in a population-insurance database that adrenalectomy was associated with a lower long-term all-cause mortality (independent of hypertension remission) in PA patients, whether MRA treatment could lead to similar beneficial effects regarding the prevention of MACE or other cardiac issues and/or survival advantage among uPA patients is still uncertain (3, 10).
In this study, we aimed to investigate the long-term outcomes, especially mortality, MACE, atrial fibrillation (Af), and congestive heart failure (CHF) of the uPA patients who underwent medically or surgically targeted treatment relative to the EH controls and to focus on the association of long-term outcomes with the statuses of post-treatment hypertension remission.

The Taiwan Primary Aldosteronism Investigation (TAIPAI) group enrolled possible PA patients who first had their aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) screened for PA case-detection and were followed-up thereafter. We analyzed all patients prospectively registered in the TAIPAI database (5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16) from 2007 to 2017.
We enrolled 1220 patients diagnosed with PA and another 1231 patients with EH; those EH patients were screened negative for any secondary hypertension during the study period in the same cohort. Demographic and clinical characteristics of all PA and EH patients at their diagnosis confirmatory stage were recorded. Patients were followed-up from the date of PA diagnosis to either death or the end of the study (end of enrollments in 2017 and followed-up to December 31, 2018).
Diagnosis and further lateralization of APA
Screening, confirmation, and subtype identification of PA were performed in hypertensive patients according to the standard TAIPAI protocol and aldosteronism consensus (2, 5) (referring to online-only Supplementary data, see section on supplementary materials given at the end of this article). uPA was identified on the basis of the following criteria during the study period (17): (i) hypertensive patients with autonomous excess aldosterone production evidenced with ARR > 35 ng/dL per ng/mL/h after captopril test, TAIPAI score > 60% (14), and post-saline-loading plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) > 16 ng/dL; (ii) lateralization of aldosterone hypersecretion via adrenal vein sampling (AVS) or during dexamethasone suppression NP-59 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT); and (iii) (only for uPA after adrenalectomy) pathologically proven positive CYP11B2-staining adenoma or (multiple) aldosterone-producing micronodules ((M)APM) via immunohistochemistry (17, 18).
Exposure
Main-targeted treatments following uPA diagnosis were with either unilateral adrenalectomy or MRA prescription. After PA diagnosis was ruled out, EH controls were treated with standard anti-hypertensive medications and monitored clinically according to best practices; briefly, a blood pressure (BP)-based treatment algorithm was used, emphasizing the European Society of Hypertension â hypertension guidelines suggestion to control BP targets to < 140/90 mmHg for all EH patients (19).
Outcomes of interest
All-cause mortality was the primary outcome; secondary outcomes included de novo(incident) MACE, Af, and/or CHF after the index date of PA confirmation. MACE included any occurrence of major coronary events including non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft, stroke, and coronary angioplasty. To corroborate long-term outcome events, we have further validated TAIPAI records with the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (referring to Supplementary data).
Clinical success after unilateral adrenalectomy
Patients were evaluated monthly during the first 3 months post-adrenalectomy and every 3 months thereafter. This cohort followed-up patients' BP readings and biochemistry under a standard protocol at 1 year after adrenalectomy.
uPA patients who underwent MRA therapy were followed-up every 3 months. De novoevents of mortality and MACE, Af, and CHF were recorded. At 12 months, for those who underwent adrenalectomy, complete clinical success (hypertension remission) was defined as normal BP without the usage of anti-hypertensives, those with residual hypertension were hypertension (HTN) not-cured according to the PASO consensus criteria (4) (Supplementary methods).
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as mean Â± S.D., and categorical variables were expressed as percentages. As adrenalectomy and MRA prescription are the main targeted treatments following uPA diagnosis, we used a Cox proportional hazards model with time-varying covariates to account for healthy survivor bias on outcomes of interest. Time-varying covariates took the value 0 before the beginning of treatments and could switch to 1 at the start of treatment. Each patient was followed from the date of the PA diagnosis to death or the end of the study (December 31, 2018), whichever occurred first.
To obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects comparing adrenalectomy and non-adrenalectomy groups, the inverse probability of treatment-weighted (IPTW) method was used. The IPTW method with propensity score was applied to correct biases in basic characteristics and outcomes and has the effect of creating a pseudo-population with a covariate distribution of the individual treatment groups similar to that of the overall study population. Covariate balance was assessed by examining the magnitude of any weighted residual differences between treatment groups (Supplementary Fig. 1). Taking mortality as a competing risk, we drew Cox survival curves separately for patients undergoing adrenalectomy or not and conducted the log-rank test to compare the risk of death among the patient groups. Significance levels for entry (SLE) and for stay (SLS) were conservatively set to 0.15.
To indicate the implications of post-operative PAC, PRA, and serum potassium levels in individual patients, a generalized additive model (GAM) (with spline) incorporating subject-specific (longitudinal) random effects was plotted and adjusted for other clinical parameters to predict outcomes of interest. We defined the optimal PAC or PRA cut-off value as log odd ratio (OR) equaling to 0 (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Finally, to assess whether observed associations between adrenalectomy or MRA therapy and the end-points of interest were attributable to different health statuses, we further compared the risks of gastrointestinal bleeding, an outcome believed to be unaffected by the choice of treatments, as a specificity test (negative control outcome). Bleeding was ascertained from emergency department visits and hospitalization episodes. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA), R software version 3.4.2 (Free Software Foundation, Inc., Boston, MA), and Stata/MP version 12 (Stata Corporation) for data analysis and figure plotting. A two-sided P_-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Patient characteristics
After excluding 303 patients with IHA or bilateral PA, 59 with pre-existing major cardiovascular disorders (CVD), a total of 858 uPA patients, along with another 1210 EH controls, were enrolled based on our diagnosis algorithm (Fig. 1).
Table 1 summarized the baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of uPA patients and EH controls.
At 12 months after adrenalectomy, 272 (49.9% of 545) uPA patients achieved complete clinical success (hypertension remission without medications). Hypertension duration was longer in uPA patients than in EH controls (all P_ < 0.05).
Post-operatively, the hypertension-remissive group had lower PAC and BP yet similar PRA and serum potassium levels as the not-cured group (Table 2).
Outcomes of interest
After a follow-up of 6.29 Â± 3.97 years, 43 patients (5.0%) died with an incidence rate of 0.76 per 1000 person-years of all uPA patients. Those uPA patients who underwent adrenalectomy had a lower all-cause mortality (3.7% vs 7.4%, P_=_0.017) and also a lower incidence rate of incident MACE (15.0% vs 21.4%, P_=_0.018) and CHF (7.0% vs 14.1%, P_ < 0.001), yet similar incident Af rate (6.4% vs 8.6%, P_=_0.230) compared with those uPA treated with MRA (Fig. 2, Tables 1, 3 and Supplementary Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
In the Cox proportional hazard model, all uPA patients after adrenalectomy in either hypertension remissive (hazard ratio (HR), 0.54; P_ < 0.01) or not-cured group (HR, 0.61; P_ < 0.01) were associated with lower all-cause mortality, compared with that of EH controls. However, patients who were treated with MRA could not mitigate their mortality risk (P_=_0.52).
We further took mortality as a competing risk and found that uPA patients who underwent adrenalectomy, either in remission or not-cured of their hypertension, had similar risks of incident Af and CHF as those of their EH controls, whereas those who had not-cured hypertension had higher risk of MACE (sub-distribution, sHR, 1.41; P_=_0.037).
PA patients matched via IPTW and their outcomes after targeted treatments
As the MRA-treated patients could be sicker with chronic comorbidities at uPA diagnosis, we performed IPTW-matching to balance out pre-existing comorbidities. Our logistic regression model of IPTW identified several factors predicting adrenalectomy (r2 = 0.81, P_=_0.68 for the HosmerâLemeshow goodness of fit test; Supplementary Table 6). Comparison between these 545 uPA patients who underwent adrenalectomy and their adjusted counterparts indicated adequate comparability between the two groups, with similar characteristics in gender, age, BP, premorbid risks, baseline biochemistry data, and anti-hypertensive drugs used at diagnosis (Supplementary Fig. 1). Results from the alternative Cox proportional hazards model, inverse probability-weighted and taking adrenalectomy as a time-varying factor, depicted that adrenalectomy for uPA could mitigate the risks of all-cause mortality (HR, 0.57; P_=_0.035; Fig. 3), MACE (HR, 0.67; P_=_0.037; Fig. 3), and CHF (HR, 0.49; P_=_0.005) better than those treated medically with MRA (Table 4 and Supplementary Tables 7, 8, 9, 10). However, there were no significant differences in the long-term mortality and MACE outcomes between the various groups of post-treatment biochemistry results (Supplementary Table 11).
Negative control analysis
To resolve concerns of possible health indication bias or unobserved confounders, we examined and compared the risk of new-onset gastrointestinal bleeding. uPA patients who underwent adrenalectomy or MRA use had similar risks of gastrointestinal bleeding by Cox regression using adrenalectomy as a time-varying risk (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.84â1.07, P_=_0.421) (Table 5).
Biochemistry cure and prognosis-significant biochemical parameters
The post-adrenalectomy PAC level was plotted against the log OR of predicting all-cause mortality or MACE for uPA patients who underwent adrenalectomy via a GAM model. PAC > 27 ng/dL, but not renin or potassium level, was found to be an independent risk factor predicting long-term mortality or MACE, after adjusting for the non-linear effects of age, comorbidities, and influential drugs (Supplementary Fig. 2). Cox proportional hazard regression analysis revealed that patients undergoing adrenalectomy who displayed higher PAC (>27 ng/dL) had a higher mortality or MACE risk during the follow-up period with an adjusted HR of 1.79 (95% CI, 1.03â3.10; P_=_0.038), independent from the PRA as compared with uPA patients with lower post-adrenalectomy PAC (Fig. 4A).
Additionally, in uPA patients who underwent MRA treatment, a PRA level < 0.6 ng/mL/h, identified via a GAM model, showed a higher long-term risk of mortality and MACE (HR, 3.85; 95% CI, 1.04â13.7; P_=_0.038) as compared with patients with higher PRA values by Cox analysis (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Table 11).
Discussion
The incidence rate of all-cause mortality was 0.76 per 1000 person-years for all uPA patients after targeted treatments. Based on the widely accepted outcome criteria set by PASO (4), either status of clinical remission or not-cured HTN after adrenalectomy was associated with attenuated all-cause mortality risk in our uPA patients, while those with not-cured HTN did not have a reduced risk of incident MACE than that of EH controls. We showed here unprecedentedly that unilateral adrenalectomy, relative to MRA treatment, led to lower long-term mortality and MACE/CHF incidence by taking adrenalectomy as a time-varying factor. Additionally, we also demonstrated that PAC > 27 ng/dL after adrenalectomy or PRA < 0.6 ng/mL/h after MRA treatment could be associated with higher risks of mortality or MACE (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Clinical cure of hypertension and subsequent outcomes
Half of our uPA patients achieved complete hypertension remission at 1 year after adrenalectomy; similar to previous observations (3). Moreover, we found that adrenalectomized uPA patients had lower long-term mortality risk, regardless of any residual hypertension. This result is different from a previous study that focused on all PA (including IHA) patients and concluded that both adrenalectomy and MRA treatment led to similar mortality rates as those in EH (3). Taking mortality as a competing risk, we further revealed that either MRA treatment or not-cured hypertension after adrenalectomy in the uPA patients was associated with higher long-term incident MACE risk than that of the controls â an observation different from heterogeneous MACE risks among various subtypes of PA patients after different targeted treatments (9, 20) (Table 3).
Adrenalectomy vs MRA
uPA patients treated with MRA had a higher risk to subsequent MACE, CHF, and all-cause mortality compared to those who underwent adrenalectomy even after our IPTW-adjusted time-varying analysis. These findings are consistent with a report of a German cohort with only univariate analyses and a population study using all subgroups of PA patients (3). A Japanese nationwide study reported a better effect of adrenalectomy than pharmacological treatment on improving hypertension and hypokalemia in all PA patients (21). Studies consistently reveal more reduction in BP and hyperaldosteronism status after adrenalectomy, which abrogated detrimental genomic and non-genomic effects of excessive PAC exposure (22). Adrenalectomy might also lead to a therapeutic effect more rapidly (5), whereas longer MRA administration could lead to poor drug compliance (Table 5).
MRA leads to less improvement on the left ventricle mass index (LVMI) than adrenalectomy (23). The percent alleviation of LVMI, in-part by the aldosterone effect, and more reversal of collagen content in the myocardium, was more prominent in adrenalectomized uPA patients (23). MRA treatment may result in increased PAC and subsequent cardiovascular events. Cortisol can exert its effects in the ischemic striatum via forming glucocorticoidâMR complexes (24) to attenuate the vascular protective effect of spironolactone in PA patients. We also acknowledged that MRA at clinical practice might be a problem calling for more attention (16). Our study also revealed the importance of dose-response analysis regarding MRA use and the occurrence of incident stroke (25).
Biochemistry levels affecting outcomes after adrenalectomy or MRA therapy in uPA
We propose that higher PAC after adrenalectomy could be a signal heralding higher mortality in regard to the cut-off levels of biochemistry cure. This hypothesis led us to further conduct a dose-response analysis regarding the association of post-surgical PAC, serum potassium level, and PRA vs long-term mortality.
We identified that a PAC > 27 ng/dL at 1 year after surgery, but not PRA, among the uPA patients who underwent adrenalectomy was associated with higher long-term mortality or MACE during further follow-up. Our findings further suggest that uPA patients with persistent post-adrenalectomy high PAC deserve more attention during follow-up visits. We speculate that post-adrenalectomy uPA patients with higher PAC could have an increased mortality risk, either with or without hypertension-remission.
Furthermore, after MRA therapy, the increase in PRA has previously been shown to be associated with a lower risk for MI, stroke, CHF, and death (8). Here in our multivariate analysis, a PRA level < 0.6 ng/mL/h at 1 year after MRA treatment could be related to higher risks of long-term incident MACE or mortality. Our result was based on a prospective follow-up uPA cohort checking biochemistry data under a standard protocol, which made it significantly different from those prior reports from insurance claim data in PA patients. We unprecedentedly report the implications of these critical cut-off levels of aldosterone or renin activity defining clinical biochemistry success after the targeted treatment; further verifications from future larger cohorts or multi-center prospective studies are needed to validate their usefulness.
Study strengths and limitations
Even though we performed extensive collections of high-quality-detailed biochemical and clinical data correlations among 858 uPA patients (out of 1220 PA patients) and their 1210 EH controls in this long-term cohort, this is still a local multi-center series with relatively limited case numbers. Most of the participating hospitals were referral medical centers; therefore, the ratio of uPA was high in our cohort. The incidences of the outcome events were relatively low, and the follow-up duration was less than 10 years, although our findings were robust and consistent across various models for a long-term follow-up of more than 6 years, implicating that some significant separation of the survival curves may happen only after 5 years of follow-up. Of note, this is the first report of clinical outcomes from a high-quality observational uPA cohort with trustily identified EH controls, which distinguishes it from other reports using population or insurance databases. A concordant finding was observed in a previous German PA long-term study (3).
As a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial regarding the effectiveness of MRA vs adrenalectomy for uPA patients over as many years as ours is neither practically possible nor ethically acceptable to conduct, our prospective inception observational cohort with comorbidities adjusted via IPTW provided a valid and feasible alternative.
Our results must still be interpreted within the limitations of observational studies. The observative comparison of uPA patients undergoing adrenalectomy vs MRA therapy will always be confounded by possible biases. We did not record exactly why the patients opted for MRA treatment; it could be patients' preference, advanced age, or higher surgical risks. Moreover, the adherence to MRA medical treatment could not be exactly evaluated. We avoided indication bias by matching surgically- vs medically treated uPA patients with IPTW (26). Furthermore, a specificity test evaluating new-onset events of gastrointestinal bleeding showed no difference between patients who underwent adrenalectomy or MRA therapy in our negative control analysis, so we concluded that the indication bias about health statuses was not significant.
In order to address the delay between diagnosis and adrenalectomy or if adrenalectomy was chosen as a starting time for survival analyses, we addressed the potential immortal time bias via our time-varying model adjustment. Secondly, co-interventional proficiency biases in patients with adrenalectomy (i.e.: more followed-up than those with MRA therapy) were attenuated by our cross check-up with a population-based health insurance database. Thirdly, in our real-world practice, patients who are candidates for adrenalectomy were more likely to undergo AVS, leading to possible indication bias.
Finally, we also adjusted the possible over-estimation from mortality as a competing risk to avoid confounding the exposure-primary outcome and the exposure-competing outcome effect (27).
Taken together, our results support the concept that adrenalectomy is advantageous through not only alleviating hyper-aldosteronism, hypo-renin, hypokalemia, obesity, and comorbidities but also playing a key role in abrogating hypertension and thus suggest adrenalectomy to be an optimal treatment for feasible uPA patients."

Using a validated algorithm, we extracted longitudinal data for all PA patients diagnosed in 1997\xe2\x80\x932010 and treated in the Taiwan National Health Insurance. We identified 3362 PA patients for whom the mean length of follow-up was 5.75 years. PA has higher major cardiovascular events (MACE) than essential hypertension (23.3% vs 19.3%, p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.015). Results from the Cox model suggest a strong effect of adrenalectomy on lowering mortality (HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.23 with residual hypertension and 0.21 with resolved hypertension). While need for receptor antagonist (MRA) MRA after diagnosis suggests that a defined daily dose (DDD) of MRA between 12.5 and 50\xe2\x80\x89mg may alleviate risk of death in a U-shape pattern. A specificity test identified patients who has aldosterone producing adenoma (HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.50, p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.005) also confirmed adrenalectomy attenuated all-cause mortality. Adrenalectomy decreases long-term all-cause mortality independently from PA cure from hypertension. Prescription corresponding to a DDD between 12.5 and 50\xe2\x80\x89mg may decrease mortality for patients needing MRA. It calls for more attention on early diagnosis, early treatment and prescription of appropriate dosage of MRA for PA patients. Although the role of primary aldosteronism (PA) in increasing cardiovascular risk and the potential of targeted therapy for PA have gained recognition, there exists a great knowledge gap in terms of long-term effects of various surgical and pharmacological treatments on outcomes among PA patients. For instance, it remains unclear whether certain targeted treatments for PA can yield everlasting elimination of high blood pressure and regression of the adverse cardiovascular changes. A cohort study reported a higher risk of cardiovascular events in PA patients than in non-PA counterparts at diagnosis, and an indifferent risk level for PA patients in the follow\xe2\x80\x93up after adrenalectomy or treatment with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). While MRA treatment seems to produce a similar effect as adrenalectomy in terms of prevention of cardiovascular events, it is unclear whether MRA treatment and adrenalectomy also grant a similar effect regarding all-cause mortality. A recent nationwide epidemiological study in Japan showed that surgical treatment had a larger effect of on ameliorating hypertension and hypokalemia than medical treatment. While normalization of blood pressure and correction of hypokalemia are important, there are other goals for effectively managing PA and preventing organ complications. It calls for more effort into unearthing better treatment patterns for reducing risk of mortality over a long term. Furthermore, it is worthwhile to investigate how adrenalectomy may lessen threat from death for PA patients with different statuses of subsequent of cardiovascular accidents (CVA), a well-recognized risk factor for all-cause mortality. Claims databases comprehensively capturing information on episodes of care across healthcare settings could make disease outcomes research greatly more promising. Taking advantage of the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) research database, the aim of this study is to test PA patients receiving adrenalectomy would have a favorable probability of mortality over a long term than their counterpart patients without the operation. We further examined whether adrenalectomy would yield similar beneficial effects on decreasing all cause mortality between patients with subsequent CVA and those without CVA. We also conducted dose-response analysis regarding MRA use and mortality. Methods Data sources The Taiwan NHI is a nationwide insurance program that covers outpatient visits, hospital admissions, prescriptions, intervention procedures and disease profiles for over 99% of the population in Taiwan (23.12 million in 2009). The NHI database is one of the largest and most comprehensive databases in the world, and has been offering research data in various studies on diagnoses, medication use, and hospitalizations. This study extracted all of the patients with the diagnosis of PA form 23,725,083 beneficiaries in Taiwan. The NHI data is generally reliable, because the National Health Insurance Administration routinely audits claims data to prevent fraud in the NHI program. Our study used a longitudinal database created by the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) through extracting original NHI data for all patients who ever had PA diagnosis in the NHI in the period from 1997 to 2010. PA identification and mortality follow-up Our study used a validated algorithm to identify PA patients diagnosed in 1997\xe2\x80\x932010, and further enrolled PA patients aged \xe2\x89\xa518 at the time of first medical record of PA (ICD code\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89255.1). The administrative data on diagnosis and MRA prescription identified patients with primary aldosteronism in Taiwan had been validated. Figure 1 depicts our procedures for selecting study subjects. Our study only enrolled patients who ever used MRA (belonging to the ATC class C03D) in the one year prior to or the two years following the first ICD-9-CM coding of PA, because this additional condition could assure high values for both sensitivity and the positive predictive value according to our validated report. Two kinds of MRA drugs are listed in the guidelines for treating PA, and only one potassium sparing agent (spironolactone, ATC code\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89C03DA01) was available in Taiwan before 2011. We further separated PA patients into a group receiving adrenalectomy and another one receiving MRA treatment. Research variables The demographic and clinical characteristics of all PA patients at their index diagnosis were recorded. The parameters included age, gender, the year of diagnosis, and various comorbid conditions, such as hypokalemia and hyperlipidemia. Each type of pre-diagnosis comorbidity was identified by a diagnosis history that indicated record for at least one hospital admission or at least three outpatient department visits during the one year immediately prior to the index diagnosis. This rule was constructed on the basis of a relatively strict criterion which was well validated. Medication exposure and adrenalectomy Each patient\xe2\x80\x99s exposure to MRA (belonging to the ATC class C03D) was measured on the basis of the cumulative dose, and expressed as the defined daily dose (DDD) according to the definition by World Health Organization. The DDD of MRA was calculated from 30 days to 365 days before mortality or the end of the study (December 31, 2010), whichever occurred first. We did not count medications prescribed within 30 days preceding any outcome event, in order to reduce potential confounding effects due to indication. We categorized and recorded the administration of other antihypertensive pharmaceuticals at the time of PA diagnosis, and confirmed delivery of adrenalectomy by referring to NHI data on surgical procedures. We defined cure of hypertension by the operation as no demand for any antihypertensive medication for at least 1 year after adrenalectomy. The NHI claims data regarding adrenalectomy and medications are reliable because they were constructed on the basis of NHI procedure and drug codes that were tied to NHI reimbursement system with auditing. The indication and guideline for hypertensive management in Taiwan has proposed and revised by the Taiwan society of Hypertension. Briefly, A diagnostic algorithm was proposed, emphasizing the ESH/ESH joint hypertension guidelines suggestion to loosen BP targets to <140/90\xe2\x80\x89mmHg for all patients. Validation of the diagnostic procedures Because there is no specific ICD diagnosis of aldosterone producing adenoma, for the comparison between patients with aldosterone producing adenoma who were treated with surgery vs MRA, PA patients with the diagnosis of adrenal tumor (ICD code\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89227, 227.0, 239.7) were further analyzed as a specificity test. This tests included two medical centers (National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), Taipei, Taiwan; Taipei University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan), and five regional hospitals (Cardinal Tien Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan; Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan; Yun- Lin Branch of NTUH, Douliou City, Taiwan; Hsin-Chu Branch of NTUH, Hsin-Chu City, Taiwan; Zhongxing Branch of Taipei City Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan). Statistical analysis Continuous variables are described as mean \xc2\xb1SD; discrete variables are presented as counts or percentages. We used the R software, version 2.8.1 (Free Software Foundation, Inc., Boston, MA, USA), and the Stata software, version 12 (StataCorp, College station, TX, USA). A two-sided p-value\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05 was considered statistically significant. We drew Kaplan-Meier survival curves separately for patients receiving adrenalectomy and those without the operation, and conducted the log-rank test to compare risk of death between the two patient groups. As adrenalectomy, MRA prescription and potassium supplement (belonging to the ATC class A12B) for hypokalemia are main treatments following PA diagnosis, we used a Cox proportional hazards model with time-varying covariates to account for their influences on risk of death in our investigation of factors associated with long-term mortality among PA patients. Time-varying covariates took the value 0 before the start of treatments and could switch to 1 at the start of treatment. Each patient was followed from the date of the PA diagnosis to death or the end of the study (December 31, 2011), whichever occurred first. On the basis of this hazard function, we further simulated and depicted 10-year survival curves of the probability of freedom from mortality under different scenarios of treatment in regard to MRA, and adrenalectomy among all APA patients. Specifically, we stratified patients by the status of MACE after target treatments. Clinical decisions for delivery of adrenalectomy are affected by patients\xe2\x80\x99 clinical conditions. To assure the interval dataset validity of comparing adrenalectomy and non- adrenalectomy groups, we generated an alternative sample of PA patients using propensity score matching (PSM) process with the 1:1 matching ratio, and subsequently estimated an alternative Cox regression model. We constructed a propensity score using a non-parsimonious multivariable logistic regression model in an attempt to make an unbiased estimate of the indicators predicting adrenalectomy. The predicted probability derived from the logistic equation was used as the propensity score for each individual. To determine threshold values of MRA dosage for favorable survival chances, we specified a multilevel discrete-time event history analysis utilizing the logistic regression method incorporating patient-specific random effects, and adopted a generalized additive model (GAM) with adjustment for risk factors listed in Table 1 and with splines regarding MRA dosage. This approach permits adjustments for possible nonlinear effects of continuous variables. To show the effect of MRA dosage on risk of death, we plotted a function curve with values of the logs of odds ratios. The curve was centered to have an average of zero over the range of the data. The approximate point-wise 95% CIs were also depicted. With dosage threshold values determined, we categorized MRA dosage levels accordingly, and incorporated the non-linear effect of MRA dosage on risk of death into the specification of another alternative Cox regression model for long-term mortality to further examine the non-linear effect on long-term mortality. Ethical considerations Because patients were anonymous in our study, no informed consent was required. As the identification numbers of all individuals in the NHI research databases were encrypted to protect the privacy of the individuals, this study was exempt from a full ethical review by the institutional review board of National Taiwan University Hospital (201303017RINC). All of the methods were carried out in \xe2\x80\x9caccordance\xe2\x80\x9d with the approved guidelines. Results Patient characteristics Among the 4895 patients with PA diagnosis in 1997\xe2\x80\x932010, we identified 3362 PA patients (68.7%) based on our diagnosis algorithm (Fig. 1), and diagnostic procedures from national health insurance data was listed in stable 1. The mean age was 51.3\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8914.7 years at PA diagnosis, and 46.3% of them (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891557) were male. During the follow up, 846 patients (25.2%) underwent adrenalectomy. Table 1 summarizes the demographic and clinical characteristics of PA patients by their status of receiving adrenalectomy. We found no significant difference in the incidence rate of coronary artery disease between the two groups at the baseline. Patients without adrenalectomy had higher incidence rates of congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), moderate or severe liver disease, and several other morbid conditions. The non-adrenalectomy group also had a larger proportion of taking diuretics. In contrast, patients with the operation had higher risk of hypokalemia, and tended to have higher demand for potassium supplement, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). In 846 patients receiving adrenalectomy, 652 (77.1%) had no demand for any antihypertensive drug for at least one month immediately following the operation, and 517 (61.1%) demanded none for at least one year immediately post the surgery. All- cause mortality All enrollee After a mean follow-up of 5.75 years, 452 patients (13.4%) died. The incidence rate of death was 23.4 per 1000 person-years. PA patients with adrenalectomy had a lower all-cause mortality than those without the operation (3.8% v.s. 16.7%, p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001). The group with the operation also had a lower incidence rate of cardiovascular event (19.3% v.s. 23.3%, p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.015). A detailed analysis of hospital care immediately before death indicates that 42.0% of all deaths were attributable to cardiovascular disease (Table S2). Comparison between survivors and non-survivors (Table S2) shows that survivors had a lower proportion of men (44.7% v.s. 56.9%, p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001), and were younger than non-survivors (49.6\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8913.7 v.s. 62.7\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8915.7, p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001). The premorbid risks were more severe in non-survivors (all p-values\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05), except rheumatologic disease. Survivors tended to have lower proportion of calcium channel blockers, diuretics, and ACEI or ARB at PA diagnosis (all p-values\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05). Survivors also tended to have lower demand for potassium supplement after PA diagnosis (42.2% v.s. 63.5%, p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001). In contrast, survivors were more likely to undergo adrenalectomy (28.0% v.s. 7.1%, p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001). Kaplan-Meier curves of freedom from mortality for PA patients receiving adrenalectomy and those without operation also depicts that the group with adrenalectomy had favorable survival advance (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001 for the log-rank test, Fig. S1). For all-cause mortality, our Cox proportional hazards model with time-varying covariates had a good validity (C-index\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.83; Table 2). Adrenalectomy appeared to be very protective. The protective effect was independent of effects from age (hazard ratio (HR)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.05 for an increase by a year), gender (HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.31 for male), CKD (HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892.16), congestive heart failure (HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.90), Liver disease (HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.87), coronary artery disease (HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.90), dementia (HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.73), hemiplegia (HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892.68), DM (HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.42), and solid tumor (HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.81) (all p-values\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001). Either operation leading to cure of hypertension (HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.25, p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001) or that leaving residual hypertension (HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.28, p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001) were protective. Need for MRA after diagnosis did not signal an impact on mortality (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.237), and so did demand for potassium supplement before operation(HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.94, p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001). Patients matched by propensity score Because the group treated medically was sicker in terms of several chronic disease by univariate analysis at disease diagnosis, propensity score matched (PSM) was performed to balance the comorbidities. Our logistic regression model of propensity score identified several factors predicting adrenalectomy (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.651 for the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test; Table S3). After the PSM process, we found matches for 822 PA patients (97.2%) receiving adrenalectomy. Comparison between these 822 PA patients and their matching counterparts (Table 1) indicates adequate comparability between the two groups. The two groups had similar characteristics in gender, age, premorbid risk, and antihypertensive drugs used at diagnosis, although patients with the operation appeared to have a larger demand for potassium supplement before operation than their matching counterparts. Regarding outcomes, we found PA patients with adrenalectomy had a lower all-cause mortality than their matching counterparts (3.8% v.s. 11.7%, p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001). Results from the alternative Cox proportional hazards model using the sample generated after the PSM process (C-index\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.79; Table 2) also indicate a very protective effect of adrenalectomy, with (HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.23, p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001) or without residual hypertension (HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.21, p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001). Need for potassium supplement after PA diagnosis still signaled a higher mortality. In contrast, although the point estimate of the HR regarding the association of need for MRA after PA diagnosis with mortality still suggests a link between need for MRA and higher risk of death, its large variance hints that the use of MRA might affect the level of risk from death. This observation led us to further conduct a dose-response analysis regarding MRA use. Comparison of the effect of adrenalectomy on long-term risk of mortality under a framework of subgroup analysis To investigate the consistency in the beneficial effect of adrenalectomy among different groups in PA patients, we further conducted subgroup analysis with respect to baseline comorbidity that further adjusted for age and gender. We found that adrenalectomy was consistently associated a much lower long-term risk of death across broad varieties of patient groups (Fig. 2). The diagnosis of adenoma and specificity analysis In our dataset, among the patients who underwent adrenalectomy and had the ICD-9 record of an adrenal tumor, there was a very high positive predictive value (96%) of APA. Furthermore, in the specificity test of this study we chose- only to include those confirmed APA patients to run the test, which although sacrificed some sensitivity, increased the positive predictive rate. In such a conservative way, we are confident to report the beneficial effects of adrenalectomy on the all-cause mortality among these APA patients. We further focus on patients with aldosterone producing adenoma as a patient with adenoma may be treated either with unilateral adrenalectomy or with MRA. The Cox proportional hazards model using aldosteronism patients with the diagnosis of adrenal tumor indicate a protective effect of adrenalectomy (HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.50, p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.005) and non-significant effect of MRA prescription (HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.72, p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.051). Need for potassium supplement after PA diagnosis still signaled a higher mortality (HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892.65, p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.005). In APA patients, our simulation results (Fig. 3) showed non-adrenaectomy had an ominous long-term association with the risk of mortality compared with a reference APA patient with adrenalectomy and without subsequent MACE for the whole period of 10 years after discharge. Subsequent MACE will augment the risk effect of non-adrenalectmoy on survival. Liver dysfunctions such as liver cirrhosis could induce secondary aldosteronism involving hypokalemia which often require spironolactone. We do subgroup analysis enrolling patients without liver disease. In line with the main result, adrenalectomy showed protective role (HR, 0.27, p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.01), however received MRA did not (HR, 0.93, p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.61). Dose-response analysis regarding MRA use and mortality Results from our GAM model indicate two threshold values for the dosage of MRA regarding long-term mortality appeared in a U shape pattern: DDD\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.17 (12.5\xe2\x80\x89mg) and 0.66 (50\xe2\x80\x89mg) (Fig. 4). Results from the Cox regression model incorporating the non-linear effect of MRA dosage on risk of death show that the adjusted HR of DDD below 0.08 relative to DDD between 0.17 and 0.66 was 1.52 (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.001), and that of DDD larger than 0.66 was 1.57 (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.044) (Table 3 and S4). These results suggest either underuse or overuse of MRA might lead to a higher mortality. Results from our additional analysis of the numbers of death incidences and the numbers of person-years in our follow-up show that few PA patients were exposed to DDD larger than 0.66 (dose equal to 50\xe2\x80\x89mg of spironolactone); in contrast, a large proportion of PA patients were exposed to DDD lower than 0.17 (dose equal to 12.5\xe2\x80\x89mg of spironolactone) (Table 3). Discussion Our research provides the first empirical evidence from a large population cohort, crossing the entire disease spectrum and representative of the whole patient population that adrenalectomy may reduce long-term all-cause mortality among PA patients, while MRA prescription may also help in this regard when its dosage is appropriate. These findings suggest a more beneficial effect of adrenalectomy over medication on long-term all-cause mortality among PA patients, particularly in those suitable for the operation. Our finding that cardiovascular event is the leading cause of mortality in PA is consistent with this interpretation. High aldosterone levels are also associated with mortality in heart failure cohorts. Our comparison of long-term risk of all-cause mortality among patient groups stratified by status of MACE and adrenalectomy further suggests that high aldosterone levels may be as fatal as subsequent MACE, and deserves more attention in mortality reduction. Our comparison of the effect of adrenalectomy on long-term risk of mortality under a framework of subgroup analysis shows that adrenalectomy could ameliorate all-cause mortality and is independent of other co-morbidities including DM. This highlights the potential value of preventing mortality by efficiently controlling aldosterone level in PA patients, and well taking the advantage of target treatment. Adrenalectomy and MRA The aforementioned Japanese nationwide epidemiological study reported a better effect of surgical treatment than pharmacological treatment on improving hypertension and hypokalemia. Previous publication in this field have also shown a difference in the cost-benefit between patients receiving adrenalectomy and those only treated with MRA. There are differential impact of adrenalectomy and MRA in regard to ventricular mass regression, with fewer or no effect of MRA on left ventrical index. Our study furthers knowledge in this field by demonstrating a difference in long term-mortality between these two patient groups. The comparison of adrenalectomy with MRA in aldosterone producing adenoma or in patients who do not have liver disease identified in our specificity test also showed consistent result. Aldosterone-producing adenoma is usually amenable to unilateral adrenalectomy, or pharmacological approaches using MRA. In the case of subsequent MACE (Fig. 3), the mortality rate will further increase. APA patients who did not receive adrenalectomy, is almost equally to subsequent MACE leading to all-cause mortality. Our result showed adrenalectomy attenuated all cause of mortality among APAs and also raised on the possibility of adrenalectomy to be on target treatment for APA patients. These findings are consistent with a report of the German Cohort, which was resulted from only univiariate analysis. Our study also reveals the importance of dose-response analysis regarding MRA use. The non-monotonic direction of the association between the cumulative defined dose and the mortality rate deserves attention. Both inadequate dosage of MRA (lower than DDD\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8912.5\xe2\x80\x89mg, as suggested by our analysis) and the extreme high dosage (larger than DDD\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8950\xe2\x80\x89mg), which is related to difficult disease control, are linked with higher long-term mortality. It is found that modest levels of MRA are sufficient to control not only BP but also cardiovascular damage in both PA patients, even at these modest doses (average at 3 years, 29\xe2\x80\x89mg/day), renal function was considerably improved. These phenomena suggest that underuse of MRA at clinical practice might be a problem calling for more attention. An important fact is that research consistently determines larger reduction in blood pressure (BP) and hyperaldosteronism after adrenalectomy and that could attribute to detrimental genomic and nongenomic effects. Also noteworthy is the finding that adrenalectomy might yield a therapeutic effect more rapidly, which was shown to ameliorate cardiac hypertrophy in PA patients. In contrast, findings regarding benefits of MRA use are limited, probably partly due to frequent occurrence of dose-dependent side-effects, especially gynecomastia, and subsequent decrease in efficacy. MRA treatment may also induce an increase in aldosterone, and subsequently trigger a vicious cycle with nongenomic effects that leads to an insufficient effect of prescribed MRA on blocking mineralocorticoid receptor activated by high plasma aldosterone level. There are other concerns about MRA prescription, such as medication compliance. As shown in an Italy study, MRA treatment was discontinued in 28% of PA patients. Possible delays in realization of the effects of MRA on improving renal function, lowering blood pressure and ameliorating indices in artery stiffness are among the concerns. As demonstrated by our prospective study, proteinuria and cystatin C, a marker of kidney function, dropped off soon after adrenalectomy, but still failed to significantly decrease one year after initiation of MRA treatment. Also noteworthy is the finding that adrenalectomy might yield a therapeutic effect more rapidly, and it takes more than one year to ameliorate overhydration and 6 years to observe reductions in left ventricular wall thickness and mass in PA patients after MRA treatment. Most of these studies have demonstrated that medically treated patients require much longer-term follow-up to manage their condition, whereas most surgical patients can be successfully discharged shortly after surgery. When possible, surgical management may represent a more expeditious means of treating PA. In summary, correction of hyperaldosterone and an appropriate dosage of MRA, as well as an adequate duration of medication, are expected to abate harms from adverse events caused by aldosteronism. Restoration of normotension Around one third of our patient cohort still demanded hypertensive medication one year after adrenalectomy, which is in accordance with previous observations. Nevertheless, our study found that adrenalectomized patients would have lower long-term risk of death, regardless of whether they had resolved hypertension that needs no antihypertensive medication or residual hypertension that still requires pharmaceutical treatment. Vascular remodeling is less reversible, and difficulty in curing hypertension increases along with increase in the length of time under aldosterone exposure, independent of the normalized level of serum aldosterone. Related to the phenomena, medically treated PA patients tend to have a larger need for antihypertensive treatment along with the passage of time, in order to achieve BP control. A prospective study investigating on blood pressure demonstrated that the adrenalectomized patients required significantly less drugs than medically treated. Japanese patients with APA, surgical treatment was significantly associated with amelioration of hypertension, while medical treatment showed no relationship. Consistent with our finding on a positive relationship between the age at diagnosis and the level of long-term mortality, an older age at diagnosis is associated with a higher likelihood of postoperative residual hypertension and cardiovascular events. Among patients with resistant hypertension, 5\xe2\x80\x9313% have PA. An important implication on clinical practice from these findings is that early diagnosis and early treatment of PA are essential for well controlling BP with tapering antihypertensive medications. In addition to underscoring the importance of a timely identification of PA to accomplish regression of BP and reductions in cardiovascular risk and long-term all-cause mortality, our study highlights the benefits of targeted surgery and appropriate medication. Particularly, adrenalectomy could bring forth a striking healing effect, and appears to be a highly promising treatment strategy. Our results mean that adrenalectomy decreases all cause mortality independently from PA cure and MRA will increase all-cause mortality in PA patients. A previous study showed no difference between surgically and medical treated patients with PA in terms of incidence of cerebral vascular accident. Difficulties in diagnosing PA unequivocally, inadequate matching among patients, and insufficient statistical power for rare events, along with differences in disease severity and duration of hypertension at diagnosis, can account for discrepancies in findings from different studies. Further randomized trials are warranted to confirm the large beneficial effect of adrenalectomy on mortality in observational studies. Study strengths and limitations The insurance disease name could not represent the severity of the disease, which includes variety of clinical status. Our research database does not contain several unmeasured confounders, including body mass index, smoking status, blood pressure, potassium and aldosterone level, which are associated with long-term mortality. Furthermore, we could not identify PA patients with bilateral adenoma or unilateral hyperplasia and thus the difference between them was obscure. However the incidence of the two subgroups is relative low and our results were robust across the different models, strengthening our conclusion that. In contrast, our study has some strengths. The NHI database has a large national sample size and a long follow-up. Reliability of ICD-9-CM codes for PA and its co-morbidities were detailed validated in our large cohort. Furthermore, our analysis taking into account time-varying covariates and dose-response regarding MRA can enrich the scope of research in this field. Time varying factors, including using MRA, cumulated dose of MRA, and K supply as time-dependent covariate in the model, ensured that patients were at risk only when they have used them. As long as patients were not receiving time varying treatments, they contributed to the untreated group and acted as controls for the treated patients during the treatment period and thus attenuated the confounders by indications. The model allowed patients to switch from one exposure group to countermanding period. In the repeated analysis, person days of follow-up were correctly classified as untreated until the intended treatment definition of \xe2\x80\x9ceach immortal time of use\xe2\x80\x9d was met, and as treated thereafter. We only shows a minimal difference in cardiovascular events between PA patients treated by adrenalectomy (19%) or MRA(23%). Although we have chosen the diagnosis time as starting time for survival analysis, the delay between diagnosis and adrenalectomy could be the healthy survivor bias. If patients with adrenalectomy are more often followed\xe2\x80\x93up in medical care than patients with MRA co-intervention and proficiency biases are likely. A noteworthy statement we would like to make is that the data retrieved and examined in this article were from health insurance registration data, where the diagnostic tests were not \xe2\x80\x98controlled\xe2\x80\x99 as ideal as some single or multi-center clinical studies. Nevertheless, imperfect as we admit it is, it is still the most \xe2\x80\x98down-to-earth\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98real-life\xe2\x80\x99 data that we could get to allow us to scrutinize some large-scale long-term outcomes of the PA patients among a population of 23 million people, according to the ICD-9 and CPT coding. We consider this \xe2\x80\x98big-data\xe2\x80\x99 approach offers several precious results and insights into the understanding of PA that were not examined and could not be offered via the smaller-scale multicenter studies. We have added the above paragraph into our discussion of the limitation of the study section. However, a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, regard to MRA or adrenalectomy over as many years as in our observational study is not possible nor is it ethically acceptable to conduct; our prospective follow-up study provided a valid alternative. Prospective Our result showed patients treated medically may be commonly under dosed is an important finding that would add to the medical literature for on target treatment of aldosteronism. It also reinforces the argument that early surgery in PA patients with confirmed adrenal lateralization should not be delayed in lieu of serial observation aimed at maximizing medical therapy, as the deleterious effect of elevated aldosterone on the cardiovascular system may be irreversible. The wide inter-patient variability of the disease probably needs individually tailored intervention. Conclusions Adrenalectomy decreases long-term all-cause mortality independently from PA cure from hypertension. The effect of PA who did not receive adrenalectomy to all-cause mortality is similar to subsequent MACE. Among patients with need for MRA after PA diagnosis, prescription corresponding to a DDD between 12.5 and 50\xe2\x80\x89mg may decrease mortality. Our study generated the largest study cohort of PA patients in the world currently, and provides the first in-depth analysis on the beneficial effects of adrenalectomy and appropriate dosage of MRA prescription on survival benefit. It calls for more attention on early diagnosis, early treatment and prescription of appropriate dosage of MRA for PA patients. Additional Information How to cite this article: Wu, V.-C. et al.
